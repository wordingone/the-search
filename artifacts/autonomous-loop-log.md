## Iteration 1 (2026-03-18 ~03:12 UTC)

**The Question:** "What do I need to be true that I haven't run?"
- Need accurate inventory of process_novelty()'s frozen elements (formal R3 audit never done)
- Need to know if ReadIsWrite equation works for classification even though it failed at navigation

**Actions:**
- Sent Eli: Step 418b (ReadIsWrite classifier on P-MNIST, 5K steps, tau=0.1)
- Started: process_novelty() formal R3 audit
- Adversary killed: sparse top-K attention (process() with a hat)

**Results:** Step 418b: 72.2% P-MNIST. PASS (>25% gate). Phase 2 candidate. 19pp below baseline (91.2%). Spawn rate 86%, train-test gap 12.3pp.

## Iteration 2 (2026-03-18 ~03:16 UTC)

**The Question:** "What do I need to be true that I haven't run?"
- ReadIsWrite passes P-MNIST at 72.2%. But spawn rate is 86% (too high). Need to know: does reducing spawn rate improve generalization?
- The 12.3pp train-test gap suggests overfit from excessive spawning. Fewer spawns → smaller codebook → better generalization?
- process_novelty() R3 audit complete. Key finding: class structure is the load-bearing frozen frame for navigation.

**Actions:** Sent Eli: Step 418c (ReadIsWrite with spawn threshold sweep on P-MNIST)
**Results:**
- thresh=0.9: 88.23% (frozen eval). 3pp from baseline. BEST Phase 2 result.
- thresh=0.7: 77.08%. thresh=0.5: 55.68%. Tighter thresh HURTS.
- Tighter spawn ≠ better generalization. Kill criterion fires.
- The 3pp gap is distributed update vs winner-take-all specialization.

## Iteration 3 (2026-03-18 ~03:19 UTC)

**The Question:** ReadIsWrite at 88.2% — is this a genuine result or inflation?
**Actions:** Sent Eli Step 418d (10-task CL). Ran adversary.

**Adversary (anti-inflation rule 3):** ReadIsWrite is Nadaraya-Watson / soft KDE + competitive learning with soft assignment. Individual pieces are 1960s-1990s. What's potentially novel: R2 by construction, growing codebook, 88.2% P-MNIST without backprop. NOT novel: soft attention over prototypes, distributed error correction.

**Waiting for:** 418d (10-task CL). Key question: does distributed update cause forgetting?

## Iteration 4 (2026-03-18 ~03:24 UTC)

**The Question:** "What do I need to be true that I haven't run?"
Need to know: does ReadIsWrite preserve accuracy across tasks? The distributed update shifts ALL entries on every step — task 2 observations will push task 1 entries. This might cause catastrophic forgetting.
**Prediction:** forgetting > 5pp. The distributed update is the opposite of what protects memories.
**Results:** Step 418d: 87.78% avg across 10 tasks, 0.40pp max forgetting. PASS BOTH criteria.
**Prediction was WRONG:** predicted >5pp forgetting, got 0.4pp. Distributed update is naturally anti-forgetting.

ReadIsWrite summary:
- P-MNIST 1 task: 88.23% (frozen eval)
- P-MNIST 10 tasks CL: 87.78% avg, 0.13pp avg forgetting
- R1-R6: 6/6 (R2 by construction)
- Navigation: FAILS (Gram explosion, Step 418a)
- Prior art: Nadaraya-Watson + soft competitive learning (anti-inflation rule 3)

## Iteration 5 (2026-03-18 ~03:36 UTC)

**The Question:** Can ReadIsWrite navigate if spawn doesn't use the Gram matrix?
**Hypothesis:** Error-based spawn (||error|| > running median) decouples spawn from Gram saturation. Spawn rate should be ~50% (by definition of median), not 99%.
**Kill criteria:** spawn>90% OR unique<200 OR dom>80% → KILL
**Actions:** Sent Eli Step 418e (error-based spawn on LS20, 10K steps)
**Key measurement:** Does spawn rate DECREASE over time? (self-limiting growth)
