## THE QUESTION

Can a system modify its own operations using only criteria it generates from interaction with an environment?

Formally: does there exist a substrate (f, g, F) where F: S → (X → S) is non-constant — the update rule depends on the state — and the system satisfies R1-R6 simultaneously?

---

## WHAT WE KNOW (validated across 2+ families)

### The Rules (R1-R6)
- R1: No external objectives. Argmin survives because it has no target to corrupt.
- R2: Adaptation from computation. Parameters ⊆ S. No gradient, no optimizer.
- R3: **THE WALL.** Every aspect self-modified. 0/719 experiments achieve this.
- R4: Modifications tested against prior state. Domain isolation solves this.
- R5: One fixed ground truth (environmental: death, level transitions).
- R6: No deletable parts. Every component behaviorally load-bearing.

### Navigation (L1 SOLVED — frozen bootloader)
- 674+running-mean: 20/20 LS20, 20/20 FT09. Centering = 75% of coverage gain.
- Graph + edge-count argmin + correct action decomposition = L1 on all 3 games.
- L1 is BANNED as metric. It's infrastructure.

### The Self-Modification Hierarchy
| Level | What changes | Example | R3? |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----|
| ℓ₀ | Only data read by fixed g | LSH: fixed hash, argmin over edges | No |
| ℓ₁ | Data in update rule | Codebook: entries move, rule fixed | No |
| ℓ_π | Encoding structure changes | Recode: learned hyperplanes | Partial |
| ℓ_F | The modification rule adapts | None achieved | Full |

### Validated Universal Constraints
- U1: No separate learn/infer modes
- U3: Structural zero forgetting (growth-only)
- U7: Iteration amplifies dominant features
- U11: Discrimination ≠ navigation
- U16: Centering load-bearing (2 families confirm)
- U17: Unbounded information accumulation required
- U20: Local continuity in input-action mapping (5 families)
- U22: Convergence kills exploration
- U24: Exploration and exploitation are opposite operations

### Three Theorems
1. **No fixed point.** R3 + U7 + U22 + U17 → system never converges.
2. **Self-observation required.** Finite environments exhaust exploration → must process own state.
3. **System boundary.** R3 + R5 satisfiable iff ground truth is strictly environmental.

## WHAT WE'VE TRIED AND FAILED

### 12 Architecture Families
| Family | Experiments | Status | Why it failed |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Codebook/LVQ | ~435 | BANNED | IS LVQ (1988). Cosine-specific. |
| LSH | ~80 | Active | ℓ₀. Fixed hash. Argmin works but is unconditional. |
| L2 k-means | ~25 | Active | Same argmin. |
| Reservoir | ~20 | KILLED | Memory contributes nothing. Rank-1 collapse. |
| Hebbian | 4 | Active | 5/5 LS20. Algorithm invariance confirmed. |
| Recode | 33 | Active | ℓ_π partial. K confound: advantage was K=16 not self-modification. |
| Graph | 10 | Superseded | No local continuity. |
| SplitTree | 7 | Chain-incompatible | Deterministic splits work, can't chain. |
| Absorb | 3 | KILLED | Noisy TV dominant. |
| CC | 3 | KILLED | Too slow (23 states). |
| Bloom | 2 | KILLED | Random walk luck. |
| CA | 3 | KILLED | Degenerate mapping. |

### R3 Attempts (ALL FAILED)
1. **Scaffolding pattern** (Steps 338-417): process() + flags/params = frozen frame GREW.
2. **Eigenform** (Steps 620-629): self-observation inert on L1 (where argmin works).
3. **Death penalty** (Step 581d): 4/5 vs 3/5 SIGNAL, but PENALTY=100 prescribed.
4. **Ops-as-data** (Step 582): op-codes self-derived, op definitions frozen.
5. **Action discovery cascade** (Steps 713-719): 7 mechanisms, all killed. Argmin equalizes usage, destroying signal. Observation stats (ℓ₀) and graph topology (ℓ_π) both insufficient.
6. **Episode-outcome correlation** (Step 717): argmin ensures every action appears in every episode. No discrimination possible.
7. **Subset bandit** (Step 719): LS20 signal reversed (survival ≠ progress). FT09 no signal (all timeout).

### The Deepest Insight (Step 717)
**Argmin is the obstacle to R3.** It equalizes action usage by design. You can't learn which actions are better by ensuring they're all tried equally. R3 for action selection requires BREAKING argmin's equalization — but every alternative tested (targeted exploration, prediction error, entropy, UCB) performed WORSE than argmin for L1 navigation.

The frozen frame and navigation capability are COUPLED. The things R3 requires the system to modify are the things whose modification kills navigation.

---

## WHAT CONTRADICTS

1. **R3 vs Navigation:** Self-modification of g kills navigation (Steps 477-482). But R3 requires self-modification of g. → The modification must be CONDITIONAL on exploration phase (but phase-conditional = prescribed phase structure = frozen frame).

2. **U3 vs R6:** Never delete (U3) vs no redundancy (R6). BMR (Heins 2025) resolves: merge, don't delete.

3. **Argmin optimality vs R3 necessity:** Argmin is locally optimal for L1. R3 requires going beyond argmin. But every beyond-argmin attempt hurt L1.

4. **Observation diversity vs discrimination:** VC33 produces diverse observations for ALL actions (delta=3.0 uniform). Can't distinguish productive from cosmetic without game-semantic knowledge.

## WHAT THE LITERATURE SAYS

### Closest Prior Work
- **Schmidhuber (2003):** Gödel Machine — self-referential, proves rewrites useful. Requires utility function (violates R1). Converges (ours can't).
- **Kirsch & Schmidhuber (2022):** SRWM — collapses meta-learning levels into one self-referential weight matrix. ℓ_F for neural systems. Not applicable to non-neural substrates.
- **Rudakov et al. (2025):** ARC-AGI-3 3rd place. BFS to frontier states. R1-compliant but not R3 — fixed exploration strategy.
- **Heins et al. (2025) AXIOM:** Object-centric Bayesian + BMR. 10K steps, no backprop. Uses reward (R1 violation). BMR resolves U3-R6 tension.
- **Mossio & Longo (2009):** Closure IS computable in reflexive domains. Resolves Proposition 14.
- **Rosen (M,R)-systems:** Closure to efficient causation. Whether the interpreter is ENTAILED by the system — open question (Proposition Q21).

### Biological Analogies
- **Somatic hypermutation:** B cells modify their own comparison operation (antibody binding site). Population-level ℓ_π. Requires massive parallelism + targeted variation.
- **Stigmergy:** Indirect communication through environment modification. Our graph IS stigmergy — anti-pheromone (argmin follows least-marked). R3 asks: can the agent modify its pheromone response rule?
- **Physarum:** Network IS both memory and processor. Edge counts ARE the computation medium.
- **Retinal adaptation:** Selective refinement without foreknowledge. Multiple receptor types at different resolutions. Closest biological analog to 674.

## WHAT'S OPEN

1. **Can compare-select-store encode arbitrary self-modification via state?** The interpreter is fixed but the state can encode WHAT to compare, select, and store. Is this expressively sufficient? (Proposition 12, DoF 8-9)

2. **What is the minimum frozen frame?** We know compare-select-store is irreducible (Step 658). But what ELSE must be frozen? The encoding? The action-selection rule? The update rule?

3. **Can the interpreter be ENTAILED by the system?** Not forced by constraints, but arising necessarily from the dynamics. Rosen's question. (Q21, open)

4. **What R3 mechanism works WITHOUT destroying navigation?** The coupling between the frozen frame and navigation is the central structural tension. Every R3 attempt killed L1. Is there a mechanism that modifies operations WITHOUT disrupting the graph dynamics?

5. **Can action selection become state-dependent without phase prescription?** Phase-conditional g = prescribed phase structure. Can the substrate DISCOVER when to change its action-selection strategy from its own dynamics?

**The question for the session:**
What mechanism allows compare-select-store to encode its own modification via state, without the encoding being prescribed?

Not "what substrate passes the chain." The chain is a LENS — it reveals whether self-modification of operations is happening. Designing FOR the chain is the same trap as designing for a level, one abstraction up. ARC-AGI-3 is a data point. LS20 is a data point. The substrate that genuinely modifies its own operations will handle them all. But a substrate designed to handle them won't necessarily modify its own operations. Direction matters.

719 experiments, 12 families, 3 theorems — all say the same thing: the frozen frame and navigation are coupled. Every R3 attempt killed L1. The question isn't how to avoid this. The question is what KIND of self-modification doesn't destroy the dynamics it modifies.

The L1 ban lifts when R3 produces its first M reclassification.
