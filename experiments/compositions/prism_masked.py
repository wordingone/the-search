"""
Masked PRISM infrastructure — permanent.

Structural enforcement: game IDs never appear in any readable output.
Only labels (MBPP, Game A, Game B, ...) appear in logs, filenames, and results.
The sealed mapping (.sealed_game_mapping.json) is written once and not read
by Eli or Leo during the session.

Protocol (Jun directive, 2026-03-29):
- Substrate initialization is DETERMINISTIC — no seeds, no draws.
- 3 games × N conditions = N×3 runs per experiment. No multi-draw loops.
- Environment breaks symmetry through observations, not random init.

Usage in experiment scripts:
    from prism_masked import select_games, seal_mapping, label_filename, det_weights

    GAMES, GAME_LABELS = select_games(seed=STEP)
    # GAMES is internal-only — never print, never log, never pass to Leo.
    # GAME_LABELS maps game_id -> label string (MBPP, Game A, Game B, ...).
    # All output uses GAME_LABELS[game] or just the label string directly.

    # Deterministic weight init (no np.random.seed — same shape = same weights):
    W1 = det_weights(128, 256)  # orthogonal init from fixed QR
