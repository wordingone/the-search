"""
Masked PRISM infrastructure — permanent.

Structural enforcement: game IDs never appear in any readable output.
Only labels (MBPP, Game A, Game B, ...) appear in logs, filenames, and results.
The sealed mapping (.sealed_game_mapping.json) is written once and not read
by Eli or Leo during the session.

Protocol (Jun directive, 2026-03-29):
- Substrate initialization is DETERMINISTIC — no seeds, no draws.
- 3 games × N conditions = N×3 runs per experiment. No multi-draw loops.
- Environment breaks symmetry through observations, not random init.

Level masking (Jun directive, 2026-03-29):
- Level numbers (L1, L2, L3) are NOT reported in any output.
- Metric: steps_to_first_progress (opaque — first time game state advanced, no level label).
- Diagnostics: progress_count (how many advances) instead of max_level / level_first_step.
- Speedup: steps_to_first_progress(try1) / steps_to_first_progress(try2).
- Apply to step 1333 and all future experiment scripts.

RHAE optimal_steps (Leo directive, 2026-03-29):
- MBPP: optimal_steps = len(correct_solution) via mbpp_game.compute_solver_steps.
- ARC: no solver endpoint. Use ARC_OPTIMAL_STEPS_PROXY = 10 (proxy until solver available).
  10 is conservative (most ARC games need more than 10 clicks), makes RHAE non-zero
  when progress reached, allowing condition comparison. RHAE values on ARC are relative,
  not absolute, until a real solver is available.

Usage in experiment scripts:
    from prism_masked import select_games, seal_mapping, label_filename, det_weights
    from prism_masked import compute_progress_speedup, compute_rhae_try2, write_experiment_results, mask_result_row
    from prism_masked import ARC_OPTIMAL_STEPS_PROXY, get_arc_optimal_steps

    GAMES, GAME_LABELS = select_games(seed=STEP)
    # GAMES is internal-only — never print, never log, never pass to Leo.
    # GAME_LABELS maps game_id -> label string (MBPP, Game A, Game B, ...).
    # All output uses GAME_LABELS[game] or just the label string directly.

    # Deterministic weight init (no np.random.seed — same shape = same weights):
    W1 = det_weights(128, 256)  # orthogonal init from fixed QR

    # Progress-based speedup (level-masked):
    speedup = compute_progress_speedup(first_progress_try1, first_progress_try2)
    # first_progress = step at which any game state advancement occurred (opaque)
    # None if no advancement in the episode.
