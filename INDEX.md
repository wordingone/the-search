| `experiments/tempest_fold.py` | Tempest Fold — State(t+1) = f(State(t), D) | Two paths converge |

**The gap (updated):** Stages 1-7 demonstrated. Stage 7: per-entry K stored as codebook data, beats global (+2.00pp) AND oracle (+0.75pp) on mixed-function problem. The update rule is modifiable data. Only Stage 8 remains: ground truth as the only frozen element. ARC-AGI mapped: 12/1000 solved (spatial transforms), constraint map of 1000 tasks built. 337 experiments. The search approaches the boundary.

## What Worked (Genuine)

- **k-NN as irreducible core** for non-backprop continual learning (Steps 97-110)
- **Feature discovery via LOO** — parity +20pp, XOR +13pp, analogy +43pp, arithmetic +47pp (Steps 130-170)
- **Iterated k-NN** = computation: CA simulation, FSMs, Fibonacci from raw input (Steps 181-192)
- **Circuit synthesis from I/O** — discovers XOR, AND, carry chains (Steps 243-266)
- **S1 unified process** eliminates CIFAR-100 forgetting (11.7pp → 0.1pp) (Step 119)
- **Constitution + constraint methodology** — 70 constraints from systematic elimination
- **Stage 5: self-discovered topology** — substrate finds b-groups from phi space (R²=0.997, Step 331)
- **Stage 6: CL filter beats designer** — competitive learning discovers filter that outperforms prescribed (+5.25pp, Step 333)

## What Didn't Work (Honest)

- **Eigenform substrate** — algebraically interesting, zero applied capability (Steps 74-96)
- **Representation learning without backprop** — Hebbian PCA, sparse coding, query transform all fail (Steps 112-116)
- **Emergent decomposition for non-Lipschitz functions** — k-NN can't discover a%b or a-b steps (Steps 286-290)
- **OOD without decomposition** — k-NN interpolates, doesn't extrapolate (Steps 225-232)
- **Substrate on ARC-AGI** — phi hurts, loop adds nothing, 12/1000 tasks solved (Steps 320-335)
- **Recursive phi** — amplifies dominant signal (b-grouping), destroys target signal (Steps 328, 332)
- **Loop generality** — weight learning is a%b-specific, 0pp on P-MNIST (Step 330)

## What Was Inflated (Corrected)

- Steps 235-278: "all arithmetic from one truth table" — I wrote the algorithms, k-NN was the calculator
- "The substrate IS a universal computer" — trivially true, but the decomposition was human-designed
- The frozen frame of decomposition strategy GREW, not shrank
- Steps 320-322: "45% pixel accuracy on ARC" — 32.6pp inflated by unchanged background cells

## The Open Problem

**Can the substrate represent and modify its own update rule? (Stage 7)**

Stages 1-6 demonstrated. The substrate computes, adapts, discovers topology, discovers its own filter. But the update rule (competitive learning, phi readout, spawn) is still Python code — not modifiable state.

Stage 7 requires the fold to encode its own operation as codebook data. Then modify it by modifying entries. The fold becomes an interpreter of its own state.

The ARC evaluation (Steps 320-335) mapped exactly where the fold fails: it's a vector machine. ARC needs graphs (object identity) and programs (conditional logic). The fold solves spatial transforms (12 tasks) and nothing else. The constraint map (418 conditional, 293 size-change, 123 symmetry, 99 object-identity) is the frozen frame specification.

Key finding from this arc: iteration amplifies dominant structure and destroys subordinate structure (Steps 291b, 295, 328, 332). One pass with the RIGHT FILTER is optimal. The filter IS the frozen frame. Stage 6 showed the substrate can discover its own filter via competitive learning (+5.25pp). Stage 7 requires the substrate to discover its own update rule.

337 experiments. Stages 1-7 demonstrated. The search approaches Stage 8.
