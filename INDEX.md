| File | What it represents | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| `substrates/living-seed/the_living_seed.py` | Purest Principle II (adaptation = computation) | Vacuous — zero effect |
| `substrates/foldcore/foldcore_manytofew.py` | Jun's thesis (spawn/grow/merge = birth/scale/compression) | Baseline, never best |
| `tempest/tempest.rs` | Physics-first computation | Dead by cycle 50 |
| `substrates/topk-fold/self_improving_substrate.py` | S1 unified process() | Close — feature loop still external |
| `substrates/topk-fold/substrate_v2.py` | LOO signal that works (+20pp parity) | Effective but unprincipled |
| **`experiments/run_step181_iterated_knn.py`** | **Self-feeding computation — the atomic operation** | **100% on Rule 110** |
| `experiments/run_step190_fibonacci_e2e.py` | End-to-end: discover + iterate | Strongest result (100%, no backprop) |
| `experiments/run_step266_auto_discovery.py` | Emergent decomposition | Killed at Lipschitz boundary |
| **`experiments/run_step296_dist_matching.py`** | **Per-class distribution matching — breaks Lipschitz ceiling** | **86.8% on a%b (vs 5% 1-NN)** |
| **`experiments/run_step333_cl_filter.py`** | **CL filter discovery — Stage 6: substrate beats designer** | **92.0% on a%b (vs 86.8% prescribed)** |
| `experiments/run_step300_reflection_spawn.py` | Reflection spawn — OOD via detected periodicity | 95.2% OOD on a%b |
| `experiments/run_step305_periodic_encoding.py` | Periodic physics + absorption = 100% | Substrate confirmed |
| `experiments/tempest_fold.py` | Tempest Fold — State(t+1) = f(State(t), D) | Two paths converge |

**The gap (updated):** Stages 1-7 confirmed ON THE COMPRESSED SUBSTRATE. External review (Step 338) forced compression: the 500-line decorated system failed S2. The fix: delete the `def` boundary between `step()` and `eval_batch()` — one function `process()`, ~22 lines. Step 339: 93.10% P-MNIST (beats original TopKFold). Step 341: state-derived threshold → 93.82% P-MNIST, Stage 7 confirmed. Self-referential loop: thresh reads from codebook, codebook shaped by attract, attract gated by thresh. S2 passes (attract load-bearing via feedback). The substrate IS process().

## What Worked (Genuine)

- **k-NN as irreducible core** for non-backprop continual learning (Steps 97-110)
- **Feature discovery via LOO** — parity +20pp, XOR +13pp, analogy +43pp, arithmetic +47pp (Steps 130-170)
- **Iterated k-NN** = computation: CA simulation, FSMs, Fibonacci from raw input (Steps 181-192)
- **Circuit synthesis from I/O** — discovers XOR, AND, carry chains (Steps 243-266)
- **S1 unified process** eliminates CIFAR-100 forgetting (11.7pp → 0.1pp) (Step 119)
- **Constitution + constraint methodology** — 70 constraints from systematic elimination
- **Stage 5: self-discovered topology** — substrate finds b-groups from phi space (R²=0.997, Step 331)
- **Stage 6: CL filter beats designer** — competitive learning discovers filter that outperforms prescribed (+5.25pp, Step 333)

## What Didn't Work (Honest)

- **Eigenform substrate** — algebraically interesting, zero applied capability (Steps 74-96)
- **Representation learning without backprop** — Hebbian PCA, sparse coding, query transform all fail (Steps 112-116)
- **Emergent decomposition for non-Lipschitz functions** — k-NN can't discover a%b or a-b steps (Steps 286-290)
- **OOD without decomposition** — k-NN interpolates, doesn't extrapolate (Steps 225-232)
- **Substrate on ARC-AGI** — phi hurts, loop adds nothing, 12/1000 tasks solved (Steps 320-335)
- **Recursive phi** — amplifies dominant signal (b-grouping), destroys target signal (Steps 328, 332)
- **Loop generality** — weight learning is a%b-specific, 0pp on P-MNIST (Step 330)

## What Was Inflated (Corrected)

- Steps 235-278: "all arithmetic from one truth table" — I wrote the algorithms, k-NN was the calculator
- "The substrate IS a universal computer" — trivially true, but the decomposition was human-designed
- The frozen frame of decomposition strategy GREW, not shrank
- Steps 320-322: "45% pixel accuracy on ARC" — 32.6pp inflated by unchanged background cells

## The Open Problem (Phase 2)

**Find a point inside all six walls (R1-R6) that can also DO something.**

Phase 1 proved: process() (LVQ) satisfies R1, R2 (partial), R5, R6 but fails R3 (operations hardcoded) and R4 (no self-testing). The "stage progression" was self-assessed and inflated.

Phase 2 has produced three substrates that satisfy R1-R6 structurally (SelfRef, TapeMachine, ExprSubstrate). None can match LVQ's behavioral performance (91% P-MNIST, Level 1 on LS20). The gap: R1-R6 structural compliance does not imply useful computation.

**The binding constraint discovered in Phase 2: U20 (local continuity).** The substrate must be locally continuous in its input-action mapping. Similar inputs must produce similar outputs. Cosine similarity provides this for free. Non-vector substrates (tape, tree) do not have it and must create it.

The constraint map (U1-U20 + I1-I9) IS the specification for the next substrate.
