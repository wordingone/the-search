## North Stars

*The 8 most significant files. Each is a different angle on the same problem. The system that unifies them IS the substrate.*

| File | What it represents | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| `substrates/living-seed/the_living_seed.py` | Purest Principle II (adaptation = computation) | Vacuous — zero effect |
| `substrates/foldcore/foldcore_manytofew.py` | Jun's thesis (spawn/grow/merge = birth/scale/compression) | Baseline, never best |
| `tempest/tempest.rs` | Physics-first computation | Dead by cycle 50 |
| `substrates/topk-fold/self_improving_substrate.py` | S1 unified process() | Close — feature loop still external |
| `substrates/topk-fold/substrate_v2.py` | LOO signal that works (+20pp parity) | Effective but unprincipled |
| `experiments/run_step181_iterated_knn.py` | Self-feeding computation (Stage 7 spirit) | 100% on Rule 110 |
| `experiments/run_step190_fibonacci_e2e.py` | End-to-end: discover + iterate | Strongest result (100%, no backprop) |
| `experiments/run_step266_auto_discovery.py` | Emergent decomposition | Killed at Lipschitz boundary |

**The gap:** principled code (Living Seed) has zero effect. Effective code (substrate_v2) is unprincipled. The atomic substrate unifies both.

Runs in ~30 seconds. Demonstrates: OOD addition (137+200=337), feature discovery, circuit synthesis, program execution — all from one 8-entry truth table.

**Want continual learning without backprop?**
```bash
python experiments/run_step99_topk_vote.py
```
95.4% on Permuted-MNIST, 0.0pp forgetting, 30 lines of core code.

## What Worked (Genuine)

- **k-NN as irreducible core** for non-backprop continual learning (Steps 97-110)
- **Feature discovery via LOO** — parity +20pp, XOR +13pp, analogy +43pp, arithmetic +47pp (Steps 130-170)
- **Iterated k-NN** = computation: CA simulation, FSMs, Fibonacci from raw input (Steps 181-192)
- **Circuit synthesis from I/O** — discovers XOR, AND, carry chains (Steps 243-266)
- **S1 unified process** eliminates CIFAR-100 forgetting (11.7pp → 0.1pp) (Step 119)
- **Constitution + constraint methodology** — 66 constraints from systematic elimination

## What Didn't Work (Honest)

- **Eigenform substrate** — algebraically interesting, zero applied capability (Steps 74-96)
- **Representation learning without backprop** — Hebbian PCA, sparse coding, query transform all fail (Steps 112-116)
- **Emergent decomposition for non-Lipschitz functions** — k-NN can't discover a%b or a-b steps (Steps 286-290)
- **OOD without decomposition** — k-NN interpolates, doesn't extrapolate (Steps 225-232)

## What Was Inflated (Corrected)

- Steps 235-278: "all arithmetic from one truth table" — I wrote the algorithms, k-NN was the calculator
- "The substrate IS a universal computer" — trivially true, but the decomposition was human-designed
- The frozen frame of decomposition strategy GREW, not shrank

## The Open Problem

**Can compositional structure emerge from data without backprop?**

k-NN discovers functions where similar inputs → similar outputs (L2-Lipschitz-continuous). For everything else, a human must design the decomposition. Transformers learn decompositions from data via gradient descent through layers. This gap is precisely characterized but unsolved.

289 experiments. The search continues.
