| `substrates/living-seed/the_living_seed.py` | Purest Principle II (adaptation = computation) | Vacuous — zero effect |
| `substrates/foldcore/foldcore_manytofew.py` | Jun's thesis (spawn/grow/merge = birth/scale/compression) | Baseline, never best |
| `tempest/tempest.rs` | Physics-first computation | Dead by cycle 50 |
| `substrates/topk-fold/self_improving_substrate.py` | S1 unified process() | Close — feature loop still external |
| `substrates/topk-fold/substrate_v2.py` | LOO signal that works (+20pp parity) | Effective but unprincipled |
| **`experiments/run_step181_iterated_knn.py`** | **Self-feeding computation — the atomic operation** | **100% on Rule 110** |
| `experiments/run_step190_fibonacci_e2e.py` | End-to-end: discover + iterate | Strongest result (100%, no backprop) |
| `experiments/run_step266_auto_discovery.py` | Emergent decomposition | Killed at Lipschitz boundary |
| **`experiments/run_step296_dist_matching.py`** | **Per-class distribution matching — breaks Lipschitz ceiling** | **86.8% on a%b (vs 5% 1-NN)** |
| `experiments/run_step300_reflection_spawn.py` | Reflection spawn — OOD via detected periodicity | 95.2% OOD on a%b |
| `experiments/run_step305_periodic_encoding.py` | Periodic physics + absorption = 100% | Substrate confirmed |
| `experiments/tempest_fold.py` | Tempest Fold — State(t+1) = f(State(t), D) | Two paths converge |

**The gap (updated):** The Lipschitz ceiling is broken (Step 296: 86.8%, Step 305: 100%). The equation is found: f = absorb. The frontier is: can the substrate discover its own physics (distance function)?

## What Worked (Genuine)

- **k-NN as irreducible core** for non-backprop continual learning (Steps 97-110)
- **Feature discovery via LOO** — parity +20pp, XOR +13pp, analogy +43pp, arithmetic +47pp (Steps 130-170)
- **Iterated k-NN** = computation: CA simulation, FSMs, Fibonacci from raw input (Steps 181-192)
- **Circuit synthesis from I/O** — discovers XOR, AND, carry chains (Steps 243-266)
- **S1 unified process** eliminates CIFAR-100 forgetting (11.7pp → 0.1pp) (Step 119)
- **Constitution + constraint methodology** — 66 constraints from systematic elimination

## What Didn't Work (Honest)

- **Eigenform substrate** — algebraically interesting, zero applied capability (Steps 74-96)
- **Representation learning without backprop** — Hebbian PCA, sparse coding, query transform all fail (Steps 112-116)
- **Emergent decomposition for non-Lipschitz functions** — k-NN can't discover a%b or a-b steps (Steps 286-290)
- **OOD without decomposition** — k-NN interpolates, doesn't extrapolate (Steps 225-232)

## What Was Inflated (Corrected)

- Steps 235-278: "all arithmetic from one truth table" — I wrote the algorithms, k-NN was the calculator
- "The substrate IS a universal computer" — trivially true, but the decomposition was human-designed
- The frozen frame of decomposition strategy GREW, not shrank

## The Open Problem

**Can the substrate discover its own physics (distance function)?**

The equation is found: State(t+1) = f(State(t), D). f = absorb. With prescribed physics (periodic encoding), the substrate achieves 100%. With task-agnostic physics, phi readout achieves 86.8%. The Lipschitz ceiling is broken.

But the physics (distance function) was human-designed. The substrate discovers codebook geometry, not the metric. Making the metric adaptive is the frontier — the point where the frozen frame approaches zero.

Two paths (The Search: 307 experiments + Tempest: first principles) converged on this equation. The substrate absorbs. The observer reads geometry. The environment provides physics. The next question: can the physics come from within?

307 experiments. The search continues.
