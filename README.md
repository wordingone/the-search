# The Search

Can a system improve itself by criteria it generates?

1018+ experiments across 16 architecture families testing substrates for recursive self-improvement on published benchmarks (Split-CIFAR-100, Atari 100K) and interactive games (ARC-AGI-3). **Step 1017 critical finding: ALL bans lifted + ALL rules suspended = FT09/VC33 still 0%.** The gap isn't constraints — it's that no generic exploration mechanism discovers game mechanics autonomously. Per-game prescribed solutions solve every level (FT09 6/6, VC33 7/7, LS20 7 levels pending). The question is now: can the substrate autonomously discover these prescriptions? ARC-AGI-3 full set launches March 25.

## Results (honest)

| Benchmark | Substrate | Result | Compare |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Split-CIFAR-100 (20 tasks, no labels) | 674 | 20.2% avg accuracy | Chance=20%. DER++=29.6% (with labels) |
| Split-CIFAR-100 BWT | 674 | +5.6% | Zero forgetting by construction |
| LS20 navigation (20 seeds, 10K steps) | 674+running-mean | 20/20 L1 | Argmin over visit counts |
| FT09 navigation | 674+running-mean | 20/20 L1 | 7-action space |
| Cross-domain transfer (LS20→CIFAR) | 674 | 0% improvement | Zero transfer in both directions |
| R3 (self-modification) | 674 | FAIL (8 U elements) | 0/777 substrates pass R3 |
| R3 counterfactual | 674 | FAIL (cold > warm, p<0.0001) | Pretraining hurts new environments |
| Atari 100K (no reward) | 674 | 6/26 above random | RoadRunner 11x, most games at/below random |

**Post-ban results (Steps 778-920):**

| Benchmark | Substrate | Result | Compare |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| LS20 nav (10 seeds, 25K) | 895h cold (clamped alpha + 800b) | 268.0/seed, 0/10 zeros | +32% over L2-norm baseline (203.9) |
| LS20 nav (10 seeds, 25K) | 868d raw L2 baseline | 203.9/seed, 1/10 zeros | True post-ban baseline |
| FT09 nav | ALL post-ban | 0/seed | Sequential ordering unsolved (Prop 23) |
| VC33 nav | 895h cold (chain) | 0/seed | First post-ban VC33 result |
| Full chain (914) | 895h cold | CIFAR=chance, LS20=237.6, FT09=0, VC33=0 | Chain: 1/4 |
| R3 encoding (Step 895) | Prediction-error attention | alpha=[60,51,52] on FT09, UNIVERSAL | First post-ban ℓ_π |
| D(s) pred transfer | Forward model W (delta rule) | 5/7 PASS | First positive R3_cf |

**Key findings:**
- **R3 encoding self-modification achieved** (Prop 22). Alpha discovers game-informative dims from prediction error alone. Universal on FT09 (dims [60,51,52] = puzzle tiles, all seeds).
- **Navigation: +32% with clamped alpha.** Change-tracking (800b) + prediction-error attention = best post-ban mechanism. 0/10 zero-seeds.
- **FT09/VC33 unsolved — bans are NOT the cause (Step 1017).** Full graph + all bans lifted = still 0%. Generic exploration can't discover multi-step click sequences. Per-game prescribed solutions work (FT09 6/6, VC33 7/7). The gap is autonomous discovery of game mechanics, not any constraint.
- **Warm alpha transfer FAILED** (n_eff=10). Alpha is per-episode adaptation, not cross-seed transfer. Cold > warm.
- **800b "10× random" retracted.** True mean = 203.9/seed (L2 norm, n_eff=10). Prior claim was seed artifact.
- Compression progress dead across 5 variants. Novelty-based action selection dead on LS20. Only change-tracking navigates.

## The Framework

Six rules for recursive self-improvement (R1-R6):

| Rule | Requirement | What it means |
|------|------------|---------------|
| R1 | No external objectives | No reward, no labels, no loss function |
| R2 | Adaptation from computation | Parameters ⊆ state. No optimizer. |
| R3 | Minimal frozen frame | Every design choice either self-modified or irreducible |
| R4 | Modifications tested against prior state | Changes must not degrade |
| R5 | One fixed ground truth | Only environmental signals (death, level transitions) |
| R6 | No deletable parts | Every component behaviorally load-bearing |

**R3 is the wall.** 0/777 substrates pass. The constraint map characterizes why. Two bans (codebook + graph) remove both tested mechanisms that satisfy other rules, forcing the search toward genuinely self-modifying architectures.
