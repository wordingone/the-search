# The Search

Can a system improve itself by criteria it generates?

1252+ experiments across 16 architecture families testing substrates for recursive self-improvement on published benchmarks (Split-CIFAR-100, Atari 100K) and interactive games (ARC-AGI-3, 150+ games, scoring = action efficiency squared). All architectural bans lifted. **R3 (self-modification) solved by component composition** (Step 1251, 100/100 across 10 games). First temporal structure signal (Step 1252, I4=1.00). Current bottleneck: R3→action bridge — the substrate modifies its world model but action selection doesn't read from it.

## Results (honest)

**Phase 1 — Reference substrate (Steps 1-416):**

| Benchmark | Substrate | Result | Compare |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Split-CIFAR-100 (20 tasks, no labels) | 674 | 20.2% avg accuracy | Chance=20%. DER++=29.6% (with labels) |
| Split-CIFAR-100 BWT | 674 | +5.6% | Zero forgetting by construction |
| LS20 navigation (20 seeds, 10K steps) | 674+running-mean | 20/20 L1 | Argmin over visit counts |
| FT09 navigation | 674+running-mean | 20/20 L1 | 7-action space |
| Cross-domain transfer (LS20→CIFAR) | 674 | 0% improvement | Zero transfer in both directions |
| R3 (self-modification) | 674 | FAIL (8 U elements) | Solved by composition (Step 1251, 100/100) |
| Atari 100K (no reward) | 674 | 6/26 above random | RoadRunner 11x, most at/below random |

**Phase 2 — Post-ban exploration (Steps 417-1081):**

| Benchmark | Substrate | Result | Compare |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| LS20 nav (10 seeds, 25K) | 916 recurrent h | 290.7/seed SOTA, 0/10 zeros | 2-2.5x over ICM/RND/Count baselines |
| LS20 nav (10 seeds, 25K) | 868d raw L2 baseline | 203.9/seed | True post-ban baseline |
| FT09 nav | ALL post-ban substrates | 0/seed | Generic exploration fails (Step 1017) |
| VC33 nav | ALL post-ban substrates | 0/seed | Same gap as FT09 |
| R3 encoding | 895 prediction-error attention | alpha=[60,51,52] UNIVERSAL on FT09 | First post-ban R3 encoding (Prop 22) |
| Bans lifted (Step 1017) | Full graph + all mechanisms | FT09/VC33 still 0% | Bans are NOT the cause |

**Debate v3 — ARC-AGI-3 sprint (Steps 1082-1097, 15 experiments):**

| Metric | Defense (ℓ₁ reactive) | Prosecution (ℓ_π forward model) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Architecture | Zero-param reactive switching | W_fwd action-conditioned prediction |
| Best single-draw L1 | 100% (10/10 seeds) | 100% (10/10 seeds) |
| Best single-draw ARC | 0.2973 | 0.0045 |
| Draw-robustness (new draw) | ARC = 0.0000 | ARC = 0.0000 |
| Modifications tested | 5 (all degraded) | 3 (all degraded) |

**Key findings:**
- **ℓ_π ≈ ℓ₁ at L1 (PB26 CONFIRMED).** Draw-robustness falsified both sides' ARC claims. All non-zero ARC scores were game-draw artifacts.
- **Simplicity is load-bearing (PB30).** Adding complexity to either architecture degrades performance (n=5+). No optimizer (R2) means extra parameters accumulate noise. Prop 32.
- **0% wall = ~2/3 random ARC games.** TWO failure modes: Mode 1 (near-inert, noise) and Mode 2 (responsive, oscillating). Neither architecture solves Mode 2.
- **FT09/VC33 unsolved — bans are NOT the cause (Step 1017).** Full graph + all bans lifted = still 0%.
- **R3 encoding achieved (Prop 22).** Alpha discovers game-informative dims from prediction error alone.
- **L2+ = 0 across entire search.** No substrate has ever autonomously solved Level 2 of any game.

**Phase 3 — Component composition (Steps 1251-1252+):**

| Finding | Step | Evidence |
|---------|------|----------|
| **R3 solved by composition** | 1251 | 7 cross-family components composed → Jacobian ∂(attended)/∂obs differs fresh vs experienced. 100/100 (10 games, both wirings). Component-level, not wiring-dependent. |
| **Hierarchy inverted** | 1251 | R3 passes FIRST (100%), I1 and I4 fail. R3 was always achievable — 0/1250 was a composition failure. |
| **Argmin dead in R3 compositions** | 1251 | I3 identical for composed substrate and argmin-alone (0.67). Argmin ignores modified representation. |
| **First temporal structure (I4)** | 1252 | Allosteric substrate (W = encoding = action selector, LPL update). I4=1.00 all games. First I4 signal in 1252 experiments. |
| **R3→action bridge = bottleneck** | 1251-1252 | R3 works, action selection ignores it. 200+ debate experiments enumerate which bridges DON'T work. Current target: allosteric substrate where encoding IS action selection. |

## The Framework

Six rules for recursive self-improvement (R1-R6):

| Rule | Requirement | What it means |
|------|------------|---------------|
| R1 | No external objectives | No reward, no labels, no loss function |
| R2 | Adaptation from computation | Parameters ⊆ state. No optimizer. |
| R3 | Minimal frozen frame | Every design choice either self-modified or irreducible |
| R4 | Modifications tested against prior state | Changes must not degrade |
| R5 | One fixed ground truth | Only environmental signals (death, level transitions) |
| R6 | No deletable parts | Every component behaviorally load-bearing |

**R3 is solved.** Step 1251: 7 cross-family components composed produce R3 (100/100 across 10 games). The wall is now the **R3→action bridge** — the substrate modifies its world model but action selection ignores it. Step 1252: allosteric substrate (shared W for encoding and action) produces first temporal structure signal (I4=1.00). All bans lifted — the search is unconstrained except by R1-R6.
