# The Search

Can a system improve itself by criteria it generates?

770+ experiments across 12 architecture families testing substrates for recursive self-improvement on published benchmarks and interactive games. No R3-compliant substrate found. The contributions: a formal framework (R1-R6), a constraint map from systematic falsification, and a novel R3 metric for measuring self-modification with counterfactual validation.

## Results (honest)

| Benchmark | Substrate | Result | Compare |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Split-CIFAR-100 (20 tasks, no labels) | 674 | 20.2% avg accuracy | Chance=20%. DER++=29.6% (with labels) |
| Split-CIFAR-100 BWT | 674 | +5.6% | Zero forgetting by construction |
| LS20 navigation (20 seeds, 10K steps) | 674+running-mean | 20/20 L1 | Argmin over visit counts |
| FT09 navigation | 674+running-mean | 20/20 L1 | 7-action space |
| Cross-domain transfer (LS20→CIFAR) | 674 | 0% improvement | Zero transfer in both directions |
| R3 (self-modification) | 674 | FAIL (2 U elements) | 0/770 substrates pass R3 |
| Atari 100K (no reward) | 674 | In progress | R1 mode (strictly harder than SOTA) |

**Key findings:**
- Navigation is solved by a trivial mechanism (graph + argmin). Not intelligence.
- Classification = chance without labels. The R1 floor.
- Zero cross-domain transfer. The substrate accumulates but doesn't learn.
- Anti-forgetting (BWT>0) is a property of growth-only graphs, not a learned capability.
- Argmin is load-bearing (14/20 vs random 6/20, n=20). Any stochasticity degrades.
- R3 metric can't distinguish useful from random self-modification without counterfactual.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup
bash setup.sh
source .venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows
# or: source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# Run Split-CIFAR-100 benchmark (no API key needed)
PYTHONPATH=. python -c "
from substrates.chain import SplitCIFAR100Wrapper, ChainRunner
from substrates.step0674 import Substrate674
wrapper = SplitCIFAR100Wrapper(500)
result = wrapper.run_seed(Substrate674(), seed=0)
print(f'CIFAR acc={result[\"avg_accuracy\"]:.1%}, BWT={result[\"backward_transfer\"]:+.1%}')
"

# Run R1-R6 audit
PYTHONPATH=. python -c "
from substrates.judge import ConstitutionalJudge
from substrates.step0674 import Substrate674
results = ConstitutionalJudge().audit(Substrate674)
for rule in ['R1','R2','R3','R4','R5','R6']:
    r = results.get(rule, {})
    print(f'{rule}: {\"PASS\" if r.get(\"pass\") else \"FAIL\"} — {r.get(\"detail\",\"\")}')

# Run reference substrate on ARC game (requires ARC-AGI-3 API key)
PYTHONPATH=. python substrates/step0674.py
```

## The Framework

Six rules for recursive self-improvement (R1-R6):

| Rule | Requirement | What it means |
|------|------------|---------------|
| R1 | No external objectives | No reward, no labels, no loss function |
| R2 | Adaptation from computation | Parameters ⊆ state. No optimizer. |
| R3 | Minimal frozen frame | Every design choice either self-modified or irreducible |
| R4 | Modifications tested against prior state | Changes must not degrade |
| R5 | One fixed ground truth | Only environmental signals (death, level transitions) |
| R6 | No deletable parts | Every component behaviorally load-bearing |

**R3 is the wall.** 0/770 substrates pass. The constraint map characterizes why.
