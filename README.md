## Question

Can a system improve itself by criteria it generates?

## Feasibility

One known system satisfies all seven constitutional constraints simultaneously: biology. Cells self-modify (R3) through metabolic dynamics that ARE the computation (R2), without external objectives (R1). Environmental selection tests modifications against prior fitness (R4). DNA provides the fixed ground truth (R5). Every organelle is essential (R6). Identical genomes in different environments produce different organisms (R0).

This is not a theoretical exercise. The constitution is extracted from observing what already works. The open question is whether computation (discrete, finite precision) can implement what chemistry (continuous, molecular) does. A single computational substrate satisfying R0-R6 with RHAE > 0 would resolve this.

## Metric

**RHAE(try2) = mean(efficiency²)** across all games, measured on try2 (with weights from try1).

ARC Prize scoring. External judgment. The substrate plays each game twice: try1 (fresh weights), try2 (carrying try1's weights). MBPP (text) always in the game pool. efficiency = optimal_actions / actual_actions. efficiency = 0 when progress never reached.

**Current best RHAE(try2) from R2-compliant substrate: 0.0** (1341 experiments, zero non-zero results).

**Reference (R2-violating):** CNN+Adam RHAE=2.4e-5, speedup=10.5x on sp80 (Steps 1305-1324).

## Constitution

Seven simultaneous constraints (R0-R6). Full definitions, falsification conditions, and evidence in `constraints/CONSTITUTION.md`.

| Rule | Summary | Current status |
|------|---------|---------------|
| R0 | Dynamics dominate initial conditions | Partial — prediction consistent, task performance untested |
| R1 | No external objectives | Holds for prediction/navigation |
| R2 | Adaptation IS the computation | Adam violates. LPL/TP comply. Organism interpretation adopted, not falsification-tested |
| R3 | Everything self-modified | Holds for weights. Open for structure |
| R4 | Tested against prior state | **Not satisfied.** Zero genuine transfer in 1341 experiments |
| R5 | One fixed ground truth | Holds by construction |
| R6 | No deletable parts | Untested on current architecture |

## Test environment

**ARC-AGI-3:** 150+ game environments. 64x64 pixel grid, 16 colors, multiple levels. 7 keyboard + 4096 click actions. Rules, goals, and action effects unknown to the substrate.

**MBPP:** Text/code generation. 128 ASCII actions. Predicting next character IS selecting next action.

## Confirmed findings

Each finding cites the experiments that support it and states what would falsify it.

| # | Finding | Evidence | Falsified if |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | R2-compliant prediction compresses weakly (3-9%) | LPL cr=0.93 (Steps 1310-1313). K=50 iterations = K=5 (Step 1322). LPL normalized cr=0.91 (Step 1328). | An R2-compliant local update rule achieves cr < 0.5 without target propagation. |
| 2 | Target propagation compression is game-dependent (54-92%) and R2-compliant | TP cr=0.08 on easy games (Steps 1329-1343), cr=0.36-0.46 on harder games (Step 1344). "92% compression" was game-selection artifact. Local targets from forward computation, no global backward pass. | TP compression shown to require a global signal. |
| 3 | CNN+Adam compresses 98% and reaches task progress, violating R2 | cr=0.003 (Steps 1305-1307). RHAE=2.4e-5 (Step 1306). Adam optimizer separable from forward pass. | Adam shown to be non-separable from forward computation, or an R2-compliant method matches RHAE. |
| 4 | Prediction learning does not shift action distribution | action_head(h3) entropy is FLAT (max) throughout training (Step 1350). TP updates h3, h3 feeds action_head, but softmax outputs near-uniform regardless. 10 engineered action selectors also ≈ entropy (Steps 1306-1343). REFLEX vs PURE_RANDOM difference was PRNG artifact, not learned signal. | action_head entropy measurably decreases during training (H_2000 < H_100). |
| 5 | All spatial representations are episode-specific | TP anti-speedup (Steps 1330, 1335). Mode map zones: try1 [3,4,4,3] → try2 [0,0,0,0] (Step 1338). CNN try2 diverges cr=20.76 (Step 1337). | A spatial representation produces speedup > 1 confirmed by seed swap control. |
| 6 | MLP processes text; CNN cannot | MLP MBPP cr=0.08 (Step 1337). CNN MBPP cr=null, wdrift=0. | CNN shown to compress MBPP text, or MLP shown to fail on text. |
| 7 | Single-layer Hebbian degrades prediction | cr=1.44 — prediction gets worse (Step 1309). | Single-layer Hebbian achieves cr < 1.0 on any game. |
| 8 | Seeds are unnecessary | Deterministic orthogonal init produces consistent results (Step 1313). | Deterministic init produces >10% metric variance across runs. |
| 9 | Game reachability is ~10-30% with random actions in 2K steps | 3/30 games reached progress (Step 1349, 10 draws). 3/10 draws non-zero. Both TP and Adam score zero on hard seeds (Steps 1344-1345). | >50% of games reachable by random play, or 0% reachable (1349 was PRNG luck). |
| 10 | Adam also fails on hard games — not credit depth | MLP+Adam RHAE=0 on same 5 hard seeds as MLP+TP (Step 1345). Adam diverges on 65536-dim input. | Adam reaches progress where TP doesn't on matched seeds. |
| 11 | Cross-game features don't transfer (childhood) | cr=1.0 on eval game after 10-game childhood (Step 1348). Weights from 10 random games don't help on new game. | Childhood weights produce cr < 0.5 on first observation of eval game. |
| 12 | Hierarchical action improves reachability 1.64× | HIER 4/10 non-zero, RHAE=7.53e-5 vs FLAT 3/10, 4.59e-5 (Steps 1351-1352). Structural keyboard coverage, not learned. | FLAT matches or exceeds HIER on 10+ draws. |
| 13 | Type_head CAN learn from self-supervised signal | Entropy drops 0.16 with change-magnitude target (Step 1353), 0.11 with info-gain (Step 1354). First self-supervised action distribution shift in 1354 experiments. | Type entropy stays flat (=max) under any self-supervised target. |
| 14 | Both trained type targets suppress clicks and regress RHAE | Change-magnitude (1353): click_frac 0.094, RHAE=0. Info-gain (1354): click_frac 0.087, RHAE=5e-6. Both worse than untrained HIER (click_frac 0.123, RHAE=7.53e-5). Action space asymmetry: keyboard always wins per-step metrics. | A type target that increases click_frac and improves RHAE simultaneously. |

## What doesn't work

| Mechanism | Experiments | Result |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Prediction-based action selection (10 variants) | Steps 1306-1343, ~30 experiments | All ≈ entropy. Action-conditional model with rich encoding (1343) showed weak MBPP signal but zero ARC progress. |
| R2-compliant update rules for task progress | Steps 1309-1348, 14+ experiments | Zero RHAE > 0. TP compresses 54-92% (game-dependent) but no level advancement. |
| R2-violating (Adam) on hard games | Step 1345 | Adam ALSO scores RHAE=0 on same hard games as TP. NOT credit depth — game difficulty exceeds budget. |
| Deliberation (fewer actions, more training) | Steps 1346-1347 | K=10 reduces to 200 actions → cr=1.0 (model trains on 200 sparse transitions, memorizes). Model-based selection on cr=1.0 model has no signal. |
| Multi-episode training for transfer | Step 1336 | Worse than single-episode. Diverse episodes produce interference, not invariance. |
| Childhood (multi-game pretraining) | Step 1348 | cr=1.0 on evaluation game. Features from 10 random games don't transfer to new games. Cross-game transfer as dead as within-game transfer. |
| Overfitting detection (internal R4) | Step 1334 | Detection triggers but LR reduction too aggressive. Calibration issue, not concept failure. |
| Meta-learned plasticity | Steps 1325, 1339 | Theta found correct direction (1325) but credit signal too weak. Theta frozen at init (1339) — normalized credit fix identified but untested. |
| Mode map / zone discovery | Step 1338 | Zones are spatial (episode-specific), not functional. try1 zones don't persist to try2. |
| Trained type_head (change-magnitude) | Step 1353 | Entropy drops 0.16 (learns!) but favors keyboard (change=15.6) over click (change=1.7). Regresses RHAE to 0/5. |
| Trained type_head (info-gain) | Step 1354 | Entropy drops 0.11. Also favors keyboard (denser exploration → more learning per step). click_frac drops to 0.087. RHAE=5e-6 (1/5), regression vs untrained HIER. |

## Compression spectrum (empirically mapped)

| Update rule | Compression | R2 status | RHAE(try2) | Key step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LPL Hebbian | 5% | Compliant | 0 | 1310 |
| LPL normalized | 9% | Compliant | 0 | 1328 |
| DFA (random backward) | 34% | Compliant | 0 | 1326 |
| Target propagation | 92% | Compliant | 0 | 1329 |
| Adam (full gradient) | 99.7% | Violating | 2.4e-5 | 1324 |

## Open directions (from catalog, 46 items)

Tested this session: mode map (#16, killed 1338), meta-plasticity (#14, killed 1339), action-conditional model (#42, partial signal on MBPP), deliberation (#41, killed 1346-1347), childhood (#44, killed 1348).

**Key eliminative finding (Steps 1344-1348):** Game seeds 13440-13444 are unreachable by ANY substrate (TP or Adam) with 2K random actions. The bottleneck on these games is not the update rule, not action selection, not credit depth, not prior knowledge — it's that random exploration in a 4103-action space with 2K steps has near-zero probability of hitting required action sequences.

Top untested:
- **Equilibrium propagation + learned halting (#43)** — R2-compliant deep credit via energy-based settling. Substrate decides when to act. Novel combination not in literature.
- **Model-based data augmentation** — train on imagined transitions (counterfactual actions) to increase training data diversity without more actions.
- **Normalized meta-plasticity credit (#46)** — fix for 1339 theta freeze. Identified, not yet tested.
- **#32/#33: Self-directed pruning / activity-dependent growth** — architecture emerges from dynamics.
- **#36: "Does the substrate understand what a game is?"** — no experiment has measured internal task-structure representation.
