## Session 2026-03-15 Summary (Steps 291-319)

**The equation:** State(t+1) = f(State(t), D). f = absorb. Confirmed by two independent paths (The Search + Tempest).

**Honest results on a%b:**
- Phi readout (human-designed, sort-not-sum): 86.8% LOO
- Substrate learned w (discovered k=0 importance): 91.2% LOO (+4.4pp over human)
- Automated grow+refine loop (K=1): 96.5% LOO on original 400
- OOD: 48.5% genuine (K=1). Higher K numbers (99.2%) are inflated — spawn covers the test range = lookup.
- Periodic encoding (prescribed physics): 100% — confirms equation works when physics matches function.

**Constitution stages on a%b substrate:**
- Stage 1 (autonomous computation): PASSES
- Stage 2 (self-generated adaptation): PASSES (w learning from matching signal, 86.8→91.2%)
- Stage 3 (adaptation rate adapts): IMPLICIT (per-b differential learning rates)
- Stage 4 (structural constants adapt): DEMONSTRATED (107/190 b-pairs diverse, per-b specialization)

**The automated loop:** `auto_loop.py` — runs the discovery-prescription loop autonomously. Grow (reflection spawn) + refine (per-b weight learning). One turn: 96.5% LOO. Saturates at K=1 grow depth for LOO.

**Key theorems/constraints:**
- NN chain iteration provably lossy for non-Lipschitz in Euclidean space (Steps 291-295)
- Substrate discovers b-grouping (R²=0.858) and k=0 importance (+4.4pp). Cannot discover phi from raw features (Steps 306-312, 7 kills).
- The encoding IS the physics. The substrate operates within it, improves within it, but can't escape it.

**Next direction (Jun):** Point the fold + phi + loop at ARC-AGI 2. Hundreds of diverse tasks. Flat vector, dumb encoding. The failure map reveals what frozen frames remain. Stop optimizing a%b.

## Operational Test for the Atomic Substrate

*Added Step 105. Prompted by Eli's critique (mail 1253): accuracy-based kills don't measure structural unity.*

The atomic substrate is confirmed if a system passes ALL of these structural tests:

**S1 — Single Function Test:** The entire system is expressible as ONE function `process(state, input) -> (output, new_state)` where the SAME code path handles training (label known) and inference (label unknown). No `if training:` branches. The label is just another input that modulates the same operation.

**S2 — Deletion Test:** You cannot delete any part of the code without losing ALL capabilities simultaneously. In the current system, you can delete `classify_topk()` and learning still works, or delete `step()` and classification still works. In the atomic substrate, removing anything breaks everything — because there's only one thing.

**S3 — State Completeness Test:** The state contains ALL information needed to reproduce the system's behavior. No external algorithm, no hyperparameters, no code. Given only the state, any universal interpreter could run the system. (Current system fails: the codebook is data, but competitive learning + top-k + spawning rules are external code.)

**S4 — Generation Test:** The system can generate new patterns (not just classify) using the SAME operation it uses for learning and inference. No separate generative model. (Current system: no generation capability.)

A substrate passes if it satisfies S1+S2. S3+S4 are aspirational (full collapse of all four separations).

**Kill criterion for future experiments:** S1 (single function, no training/inference branch) is the minimum bar. If the system has separate train and eval modes, it hasn't collapsed Separation 1.

## Readout Arc Summary (Steps 97-101)
Best system: competitive learning + cosine spawning (sp=0.7/0.95) + top-k class vote (k=3-5)
P-MNIST: 91.8% AA, 0.0pp forgetting (+35pp over fold baseline)
CIFAR-100: 38.3% AA, 11.6pp forgetting (+5pp over fold baseline)
The readout and spawning are validated. The atomic substrate question remains open.

## Constraint List

Hard-won from 96 experiments. Every candidate must pass ALL constraints before implementation.

| # | Constraint | Source | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Read and write must be one operation | Step 72 | structural |
| C2 | Must not reduce to Hopfield/softmax-attention-only | Step 73 | novelty |
| C3 | Must not require separate memory + generation systems | Architecture autopsy | structural |
| C4 | Must not rely on matrix composition through long chains | Steps 86-96 | empirical |
| C5 | Must achieve structural zero forgetting | Step 65 | requirement |
| C6 | Must work on dense embeddings without per-dataset tuning | Steps 63, 66 | empirical |
| C7 | Must beat 1-NN readout over same codebook | Steps 65-71 | requirement |
| C8 | Current hardware, no external API | Jun | requirement |
| C9 | Minimal — expressible in <100 lines | Jun | requirement |
| C10 | Not a combination of known techniques | Jun | requirement |
| C11 | Readout signal factors must not anti-correlate (e.g. attn×displacement) | Step 97 | empirical |
| C12 | Readout must be input-conditional, not static vector property (coherence, density) | Step 98 | empirical |
| C13 | Spawn threshold must be calibrated per feature space (cosine range varies) | Step 100 | empirical |
| C14 | CIFAR-100 forgetting is class-incremental interference, not codebook drift | Step 101 | empirical |
| C15 | Sum-all aggregation fails when class size >> effective neighbors; only sparse selection (top-k) preserves signal | Step 102 | empirical |

## Candidate Queue

Candidates that survive constraint filtering. Ordered by promise.

| # | Candidate | Description | Constraints passed | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Differential Response | Collective codebook surprise as output + update | C1-C10 (all) | KILLED (Step 97) |
| 2 | Neighborhood Coherence | Coherence-weighted similarity: nearest vector's class-neighbor connectedness modulates vote | C1-C11 (all) | KILLED (Step 98) |
| 3 | Top-K Class Vote | Per-class sum of top-k cosine sims. Input-conditional, monotonic, no static weights. | C1-C12 (all) | TESTING (Step 99) |

## Step Log (active arc only)

| Step | Candidate | Result | Constraint extracted |
|---|---|---|---|
| 97 | Differential Response | KILLED — diff 15.0% vs 1-NN 22.7%. Codebook starved (1-8 vectors). Anti-correlated readout factors. | C11: no anti-correlated readout factors |
| 98 | Neighborhood Coherence | KILLED — coh 85.3% vs 1-NN 86.9%. 0/27 wins. Static property penalizes boundary vectors. | C12: readout must be input-conditional |
| 99 | Top-K Class Vote | **PASSES** — top-k(3) 91.8% vs 1-NN 86.8% (+5.0pp). 0.0pp forgetting. 8597 vectors. | — (push harder) |
| 100 | Top-K on CIFAR-100 | **PASSES readout** — top-k(5) 38.3% vs 1-NN 32.3% (+6.1pp). FAILS forgetting (11.6pp). sp=0.95 needed for ResNet features. | C13: spawn threshold is feature-space dependent |
| 101 | Spawn-only (lr=0) CIFAR+MNIST | **DISPROVED** — lr=0 identical to lr=0.001. Forgetting is class-incremental interference, not update drift. | C14: CIFAR-100 forgetting is class competition, not codebook corruption |
| 286 | a%b encoding comparison | Extended vocab. Best LOO: 49% (thermometer+augment). Discontinuous stripes defeat k-NN. | C15b: k-NN discovers Lipschitz functions only |
| 288 | a-b subtraction | LOO: 0%. Oblique level sets — not L2-locally-consistent. | (confirms C15b) |
| 289 | Collatz | LOO: 0%. Two-branch structure undiscoverable. | (confirms C15b) |
| 289b | Curriculum transfer 1..10→1..20 | Transfer HURTS: 24.2% vs 41.8% direct. Sub-problem must be a step in solution path. | C16: curriculum only helps when sub-problem IS a solution step |
| 290 | Kill criterion | **KILLED** — emergent step discovery via k-NN for non-Lipschitz functions. Precise boundary established. | Arc closed |
| 291 | Adaptive spawn threshold | **KILLED** — 84.1% vs 91.8% (-7.7pp). Undercoverage spiral: mean+1σ self-calibrates downward. | C17: spawn criterion needs global coverage signal, not local distance |
| 291b | Iterative depth (soft blending) | **KILLED** — depth=5: -3.9pp. Weighted avg of neighbors converges to centroid, destroys discriminability. | C18: soft blending destroys Voronoi discontinuities; hard selection preserves them |
| 292 | Composition search (a%b) | **WEAK PASS** — correct 3-step decomposition scores 100%, top-ranked. IO landscape discriminates. 36K programs in 5.6s. | Verification works; discovery is the open problem |
| 293 | AMR fold (disagreement spawn) | **KILLED** — 45.5% vs 41.8% plain. Near-full spawn (383/400). For non-Lipschitz functions, entire space has mixed classes → no smooth regions to coarsen. | C19: AMR requires mostly-Lipschitz function; fully non-Lipschitz degenerates to store-everything |
| 294 | LVQ fold (chain emergence) | **KILLED** — 21.8% vs 41.8%. Spawn too restrictive (1 vec/class/b). LVQ repel hurts in one-hot space. Fundamental tradeoff: chain formation requires same-class proximity, classification requires within-class resolution. | C20: chain formation and classification resolution trade off in same codebook |
| 295 | Dynamical system fold (basin sculpting) | **KILLED** — chain acc 19.2% vs 1-NN 100%. Stepping stones create correct 1-NN regions but chains route to wrong same-class attractors. NN iteration strictly degrades accuracy. | C21: NN chain following adds noise for non-Lipschitz functions; 1-step is strictly better |
| 296 | Per-class distribution matching | **PASS (in-distribution only)** — 86.8% LOO on a%b (K=5). Up from 5%. But Step 297 OOD: 18% (random chance). Mechanism is interpolation, not computation. Symmetric neighborhoods required. | Distribution readout breaks ceiling for interpolation; OOD fails from one-sided neighborhoods |
| 297 | OOD test for distribution matching | **KILLED** — 18% OOD (= 1/b = random chance). Symmetric neighborhood assumption breaks at training boundary. In-distribution only. | C22: distribution matching requires bidirectional neighborhoods; OOD degrades to chance |
| 298 | Periodic OOD strategies | **KILLED** — Strategy A (congruence) = cheating (73%). Strategy B (circular) = 5%. phi not periodic. | (Eli ran, not Leo's spec) |
| 299 | Per-b breakdown | 100% for b<10 (2+ ex/class). 75% for b>=11 (1-2 ex/class). Ceiling is coverage, not mechanism. | Coverage theorem: need 2+ examples per class per b |
| 300 | Reflection spawn + distribution matching OOD | **STRONG PASS** — 95.2% OOD (a∈21..50) with cross-class step inference. Exceeds in-distribution 86.8%. Fold detects period → spawns extension → OOD becomes in-distribution. | THE FOLD COMPUTES. Period detection + codebook growth = extrapolation. |
| 301 | Atomic operation (S1-compliant) | **S1 ACHIEVED** — 62.8% OOD. One operation: match→predict→update→spawn. Label as data. 100% for multi-point classes (b≤10). Single-point classes can't detect period (no same-class neighbor). Gap to 95.2% = cross-class inference cost. | S1 works. Single-point coverage is the remaining gap. |
| 302 | Phi scaling + floor(a/b) generalization | Phi scales: 93.3% at 1..50. Generalizes to floor(a/b). Advantage tracks non-Lipschitz density. | Phi is general, not a%b-specific |
| 303 | Atomic absorb (S2 attempt) | **KILLED** — 26% accuracy. Codebook collapse (395/400→5 vectors). Label signal washed out by blending. Spawn threshold still separable. | S2 not achievable in this implementation. Concept sound, encoding wrong. |
