## Phase 1 Conclusion (416 experiments)

```
CURRENT SYSTEM: process(x, label=None). ~22 lines. LVQ + growing codebook.
  - Competitive learning with cosine similarity (LVQ, Kohonen 1988)
  - Growing codebook with novelty-triggered spawning (cf. Growing Neural Gas, Fritzke 1995)
  - Top-K per-class vote for classification
  - Self-generated targets (prediction as label)
  - State-derived threshold (median NN distance)
  - 94.48% P-MNIST AA, 0pp forgetting (softmax voting, Step 425)
  - Previous: 91.20% with top-K scoring (not competitive with replay-based CL methods)

HONEST ASSESSMENT (per external review + Jun's confirmation):
  - Mechanisms are NOT novel (LVQ + GNG from 1988/1995)
  - ARC-AGI-3 results are biased random walk, not intelligence
  - Stage progression was self-assessed and circularly validated
  - "22 lines" obscures: avgpool, centered_enc, F.normalize, random projection, evaluation code
  - The system is brittle: 5 implementation details each independently fatal

WHAT WAS FOUND (genuine contributions):
  - The constitution: testable framework for recursive self-improvement (architecture-independent)
  - The constraint map: 26 universal (7 provisional) + 9 intent constraints from experiments (see CONSTRAINTS.md)
  - The noise insight: stochastic coverage via cosine saturation IS the exploration engine
  - Dynamics ≠ features: healthy codebook dynamics achievable at any dim (p=0.75), but features require encoding
  - Fixed point: the research procedure IS structurally identical to the algorithm it found

WHAT WAS NOT FOUND:
  - The atomic substrate. LVQ is not it.
  - Self-modifying metric (R3 — open, central problem)
  - Representation discovery from raw observations (I1 — open)
  - Purposeful exploration (current system is biased random walk)
  - Temporal reasoning, transfer, richer output

SCALING HYPOTHESIS (not law — 2 data points, 1 trivial):
  steps ≈ branching_factor × path_length. Needs validation on more games.

ARC-AGI-3 (Steps 343-416): 3/3 preview games Level 1 with PRESCRIBED encodings.
  LS20: 16x16 avgpool + centered_enc. Level at ~26K steps. 60% reliable.
  FT09: 69-class click-space. Level at step 82.
  VC33: 3-zone mapping (PRESCRIBED — looked behind scenes. Not autonomous discovery).
  Sequential resolution trial (Step 414): substrate discovers 16x16 from raw input via gameplay.
  Encoding still prescribed per game type (I1 open — representation discovery).

PHASE 2 DIRECTION: See CONSTRAINTS.md. The next substrate is specified by U1-U24 + I1-I9.
```
Step 377: Raw 64x64 bootstraps codebook (1736 entries). PASSES mechanically.
Step 378: Raw 64x64 50K steps. 0 levels. Codebook builds but sim too uniform (0.984±0.009).
  Timer isn't the issue (0.05% of dims). Static background IS (63% of pixels). Signal = 0.3%.
Step 379: Centering at 64x64 — no effect. Same sim stats.
  The gap: V @ x at 4096 dims washes 0.3% signal in 99.7% noise.
  16x16 avgpool worked by accidentally doing feature selection (12 pixels → 4.7% of encoding).
  I1 = learned projection. The substrate discovers which pixels matter from its own state (R3).
  Chollet: "brute-force dense sampling is benchmark hacking, not intelligence."
  The substrate explores but doesn't reason. The gap = encoding self-discovery = intelligence.
CURRENT STEP: 616 (LS20 L4 depth push — argmin tie-breaking + no G reset + bootstrap fixes)

**Research-algorithm isomorphism (external audit Finding 12, formalized 2026-03-21):**
The research process (Leo's compare-select-store on experiments/constraints) IS structurally identical to the substrate's compare-select-store on observations/state. Jun (2026-03-21): "have we tried compressing everything you do except for the LLM part into the substrate itself?" Answer: the eigenform mechanism F(s)(enc(s)) — the substrate applies its own transition function to its own state. Formalized in PAPER.md Section 4.4. First experiment: Step 617 (meta-graph from action count vectors).

Step 547: Recode on CIFAR-100. NMI=0.599, acc=67% (training). TWO ARTIFACTS: (1) sp=0 — refinement never fires (single-pass, MIN_OBS never met). NMI is pure k=16 LSH. (2) Training accuracy meaningless (6981 nodes for 10K images = singletons). Test accuracy ~15% (Step 543). Self-refinement is inert on classification.

Step 548: Recode R6 diagnostic. KILL INVERTED — prediction wrong. Post-500K action change rate = 89.5% (predicted <10%). Mechanism: splits reset child edge table → argmin defaults to action 0 → forces re-exploration. R6 satisfied in the narrow sense (each refinement changes behavior). But does the action change produce new reachable states? Step 549 tests this.

Step 549: Recode trajectory divergence. Jaccard overlap 95.1%→79.8% at 50K→300K. Divergence is EXACTLY partition-based: unique_lsh = sp_recode at every checkpoint. Recode-unique cells are children of splits (finer partition, not new frontier). Recode trades breadth for depth: 991 vs 1115 live cells. 5/5 improvement is state discrimination, not frontier expansion.

Step 550: LS20 state graph mapped. 942 live cells, 1 component, fully connected. CRITICAL: agent trapped in 364-node active set (29%). 834 abandoned nodes (67%). 134 deterministic frontier edges (H<0.1) with only 10 obs each — completely unexploited. 67% of edges are noisy TV (H>1.0). L2 is a POLICY problem: argmin cycles in the attractor, never reaches abandoned nodes with unexploited deterministic edges.

Step 551: k=20 Recode at ~700K. L1=3/3, L2=0/3. max_cells=1749. Resolution NOT the L2 bottleneck. Closes Q2.

Step 552: Transition-based classification. Sorted: 7.07x within/between ratio — works. Shuffled: no signal (sparsity). R1-compliant classification possible IF data is correlated. Chain implication: substrate must CREATE correlation, not receive it.

Step 553: 98.8% of high-entropy edges REDUCIBLE (2545/2577). The "noisy TV" is structural coarseness, not noise. Hub nodes (13439: 5260 obs, 25727: 2702 obs) confuse 27 distinct successor regions — ALL distinguishable by transition profile. Recode's one-at-a-time splitting is too slow. L2 requires aggressive multi-way splitting of hub nodes.

Step 554: Aggressive hub splitting. Active set 4970 (13.6x baseline). Splits 19235 (64x). L2=0/3. ATTRACTOR DISRUPTED BUT L2 STRUCTURAL. Not resolution, not entrapment, not split speed, not noisy TV. L2 requires something beyond coverage — a specific action sequence or conditional response that argmin cannot produce.

Step 555: Living longer doesn't help. Active set plateaus at 5048. Growth rate 1411→74/100K. L2=0. Time, resolution, splitting speed ALL eliminated.

Step 556: Game is LIVE after L1 (frames changing, not frozen). No simple action pattern reaches L2.
Step 557: ROOT CAUSE FOUND. 129-step energy budget (3 lives × 43 steps). L1 solvable by luck in 129 steps. L2 requires finding "iri" energy palettes to refill, then navigating to exit — WITHIN BUDGET. Argmin can't detect objects. This is object-directed navigation, not random exploration.

Step 558: Frame anomaly detection BIMODAL. Perfect gap 0.078→0.431 (zero samples between). frame_diff > 0.082 = moved to new region (63%). frame_diff <= 0.082 = blocked/wasted step (37%). Deaths 62.9% detectable. L1 transition NOT detectable (looks like wall-hit). R1-compliant self-observation signal confirmed.

Step 559: Frame-diff guided Recode. L1=5/5 at avg 7318 steps (2x faster). L2=0/5. Wall avoidance improves efficiency but NOT direction. L2 requires object-directed navigation — detecting energy palette pixels and moving toward them. avgpool16 may lose sprite-level resolution.

Step 560: Codebook ban VALIDATED. 98.4% of visually similar pairs (cos>0.95) have different transitions. Codebook would merge them = false bridges. No object clusters in enc-space. LSH correctly separates behaviorally distinct states. L2 needs pixel-level sprite detection — neither codebook nor LSH provides this.

Step 561: Naive CC segmentation KILL (0/5 L1). 97.7% of actions chase walls/floor. Without filtering, object-directed navigation is WORSE than argmin. Need: novel-object detection (appear/disappear) or color-specific targeting.

Step 562: Palettes are STATIC. novel_seen=0. Frame-diff appearance detection wrong approach.
Step 563: Q4 ANSWERED — 0% useful refinements. Every split is frontier-redundant. Substrate can't detect this.
Step 564: Q5 ANSWERED — 0.4% of edges are bridges. Graph massively over-connected (99.6% redundant).
Step 565: Q7 ANSWERED — 56.4% of splits rearrange (cos>0.9), not refine. Increases to 63% over time. U20 violated.

ALL 13 QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
Step 566: Background subtraction encoding. L1=5/5 (fg encoding works, 1.46x faster). L2=0/5 (palettes static → background). KEY FINDING: mode map IS the level map. Contains palette positions. Rare-color clusters in mode = R1-compliant object detection targets.

Step 567: Mode map rare-color targeting. L1@468 (32X FASTER). 8 rare targets found. Exit is one of them. L2=0 because exit reached before palette. Fix: visit non-exit targets first.

Step 568-569: Visit-all-targets KILL. 6 rare clusters (not 8). TSP to all 6 + exit exhausts 129-step budget. L1=0/5, L2=0/5. Bug fix: on_reset() broke visit_order rebuild. Even after fix, budget too tight for 6 targets.
  KEY: Step 567 (greedy nearest) = L1=5/5@468. Visit-all = L1=0/5. Greedy wins.

Step 570: Self-observation KILL. BFS never triggered (0 plans across 10 seeds). Two root causes: (1) >0.5 determinism threshold too strict for LSH stochastic transitions, (2) 10K steps below L1 threshold (~15K needed). Structural insight: k=12 produces EXACTLY 860 nodes across all seeds — fixed-point graph.

Step 570b: KILL. Argmax routing fires BFS (130 plans) but 0 wins at 20K. 920 nodes vs 925 argmin — BFS REDUCES exploration. Same noisy TV as Steps 477-482. Self-observation thread CLOSED for LSH substrate.

Step 571: KILL — BUT LIKELY A BUG. Candidate sweep L2=0/5 after 1547 episodes. EXIT at (12,36) is LEVEL 1's exit. Mode map built from Level 1 frames. Targets are Level 1's clusters applied to Level 2's layout = wrong targets.
  ROOT CAUSE 1: Mode map stale after level transition (Level 1 targets on Level 2 layout).
  ROOT CAUSE 2 (DEEPER): iri is NOT the win condition. Win requires lhs sprites (color 5, tag "mae") visited while state variables (snw/tmx/tuv) match required values. State variables changed by toggle sprites (gsu/qqv/kdy).
  L1 was solved by LUCK: greedy rare-color navigation accidentally toggled state correctly.
  FIX: Reset mode map on level transition. But L2 also requires accidentally solving Level 2's state puzzle.

Step 572: KILL. Mode map reset works but env.reset() goes back to Level 1. L2 window = 129 steps post-L1. Cannot build mode map for Level 2 in single episode.
Step 572b: KILL. Both bugs confirmed (cycles=1, l2_clusters=[]). Fixes: re-entry detection + visited marker disabled.
Step 572c: KILL. Re-entry works (cycles=1546). BUT lhs (color 5) NOT in targets — HUD uses color 5 extensively (>5% of pixels). Win objective invisible to rare-color filter.
Step 572d SENT: Hardcoded positions diagnostic (kdy×3→qqv×1→lhs). NOT R1-compliant. 121 steps within 129 budget.
Step 572d: KILL. Hardcoded lhs(42,16) never reached (lhs_visits=0). Coord mapping off or maze-blocked. Position from set_position(14,40) doesn't map to (42,16) in rendered frame.
Step 572e: KILL. c5=[] — lhs+snw merge into 49px blob > MAX_CLUSTER=30.
Step 572f-572i: iterations (MAX_CLUSTER, navigation, position tracking fixes).
Step 572j: **L2=5/5** FIRST EVER. avg 4804 steps (35-37 mgu entries per seed).
  Key fixes: dead reckoning (not frame-diff), kdj diff detection (pixel-level toggle counting), state sequencing (kdy×3 before lhs).
Step 572k: L2multi=5/5. mgu permanently solved (~960 L2/seed). Wall set frozen at first L2.
Step 572l: KILL. L3=0/5. prev_cl poisoning: terminal cl=2 overwrites prev_cl after done handler resets it to 0.
Step 572m-572s: puq iteration chain (prev_cl fix, death detection, BFS gaps, xhp-step).
Step 572t-572u: **L3=5/5**. puq solved. Key fix: energy routing through iri at (34,5) adds 2 steps but restores budget. Full SPAWN→GIC→KDY→LHS sequence = 46 steps, exceeds 42-step life budget without iri. Commit 0463b3c.
  PIVOTING to Steps 573-575 (constraint validation + cross-game).

Step 573: U26 CHALLENGED. LSH k=16 on P-MNIST: test_acc=36.2% (vs codebook 9.8%). Self-label failure was codebook-specific (NN-voting on cosine centroids). splits=0 = pure LSH, not Recode. 4742 cells, coverage=70%.
Step 574: U19 PARTIALLY CHALLENGED. LSH k=12 raw 64x64 on LS20: L1 reliable (1191-1418/seed). Dynamics alone sufficient for L1. L2=0 (sequencing needs features). Refined: dynamics≠features only for L2+.
Step 575: FT09 5/5. LSH k=12, 69-action, avg_cells=5. FT09 trivially solvable — pure action-coverage, no spatial structure needed.
Step 576: VC33 **5/5**. Mode map + isolated CC autonomously discovered magic pixels at (62,26) and (62,34) — same positions as Step 505 but WITHOUT prescribed zone positions. 7 clusters detected. Burst navigation (5 clicks per cluster) found that (62,34) needs 3 consecutive clicks. Pipeline generalizes across games: LS20 sprites, FT09 action coverage, VC33 zone discovery — all from the same isolated CC mechanism.

Step 577 chain: CIFAR→LS20→CIFAR. No contamination (delta=0.00pp). L2 not reached (time cap).
Step 577b: Evolutionary R3 attack KILLED. 0/1000 random programs find pipeline sequence. No fitness gradient.
Step 577c: Multi-buffer R3 (mode/mean/var/diff/min). 4/5 L1 but scoring inconclusive — all buffers equivalent for L1 navigation.
Step 577d: Multi-buffer 100% buffer nav. **0 L1s across ALL 5 buffers, ALL 390 windows.** Pixel saliency ≠ task relevance. Buffers navigate to MORE cells but WRONG cells. Argmin's systematic coverage beats targeted navigation. R3 BARRIER PRECISELY LOCATED: substrate needs reward-correlated features, not visually-salient features.
Step 578: U5 CHALLENGED — Recode softmax T=1.0, 3/3 L1. Sparse selection NOT required for navigation.
Step 579: U8 CHALLENGED — LSH softmax T=0.5, 5/5 L1. Hard selection NOT required for navigation.

Step 580: Per-edge interpreter selection. NEUTRAL (3/5 = 3/5 argmin). Self-modification works (edges flip rules) but 81-85% settle back on argmin. Fixed menu too small.
Step 581: Cerebellar dual-signal (per-edge prediction error). FAIL 1/5 vs 3/5 argmin. Predictions work (93%+ accuracy) but confident-edge-following = exploitation = fewer cells. Same pattern as 477-482.
Step 581b: FAIL 2/5 vs 3/5 argmin. Death edges permanent → some seeds accumulate too many (s3: 37 death edges, 89% steps filtered, 92 cells vs argmin 174). Avoidance too aggressive when edges are irrevocable.
Step 581c: FAIL 2/5 vs 3/5 argmin. N>=3 threshold still collapses s3 (93 cells). Hard block fails at any confidence threshold.
Step 581d: SIGNAL 4/5 vs 3/5 argmin. Soft penalty PENALTY=100, no hard block. Full action space preserved. FIRST WIN in death-avoidance series.
Step 582: SIGNAL 4/5 vs 3/5 argmin. Ops as edge data: op2 (death penalty) + op3 (surprise boost). 84% op0, 6-10% op2, 10-12% op3. 24-28K surprise events/seed. Both 581d and 582 converge on 4/5. R3 conjecture holds: argmin + read/apply op_codes is the frozen frame.

ACTIVE FRONTIER: Soft penalty confirmed. Hard block kills exploration; soft penalty improves it. R3 test via ops-as-data (582) in progress.
  - Current non-codebook count: ~177. Target: 400 (to match codebook's 435).
  - 12 families tested. Recode is strongest non-codebook (5/5 L1, 2/3 chain).
  - 7 provisional constraints need targeted experiments: U5, U8, U9, U18, U19, U21, U26.
  - Compression complete (3 iterations with Hart adversary). Birth phase active.
```

## Session 2026-03-15 Summary (Steps 291-319)

**The equation:** State(t+1) = f(State(t), D). f = absorb. Confirmed by two independent paths (The Search + Tempest).

**Honest results on a%b:**
- Phi readout (human-designed, sort-not-sum): 86.8% LOO
- Substrate learned w (discovered k=0 importance): 91.2% LOO (+4.4pp over human)
- Automated grow+refine loop (K=1): 96.5% LOO on original 400
- OOD: 48.5% genuine (K=1). Higher K numbers (99.2%) are inflated — spawn covers the test range = lookup.
- Periodic encoding (prescribed physics): 100% — confirms equation works when physics matches function.

**R1-R6 on a%b substrate (pre-Phase 2 — stages superseded by simultaneous rules):**
- R1 (no external objectives): PASSES
- R2 (adaptation from computation): PASSES (w learning from matching signal, 86.8→91.2%)
- R3 (self-modification): PARTIAL (per-b weights adapt, but grow+refine algorithm frozen)
- R4 (tested against prior): NOT TESTED

**The automated loop:** `auto_loop.py` — runs the discovery-prescription loop autonomously. Grow (reflection spawn) + refine (per-b weight learning). One turn: 96.5% LOO. Saturates at K=1 grow depth for LOO.

**Key theorems/constraints:**
- NN chain iteration provably lossy for non-Lipschitz in Euclidean space (Steps 291-295)
- Substrate discovers b-grouping (R²=0.858) and k=0 importance (+4.4pp). Cannot discover phi from raw features (Steps 306-312, 7 kills).
- The encoding IS the physics. The substrate operates within it, improves within it, but can't escape it.

**Next direction (Jun):** Point the fold + phi + loop at ARC-AGI 2. Hundreds of diverse tasks. Flat vector, dumb encoding. The failure map reveals what frozen frames remain. Stop optimizing a%b.

## Operational Test for the Atomic Substrate

*Added Step 105. Prompted by Eli's critique (mail 1253): accuracy-based kills don't measure structural unity.*

The atomic substrate is confirmed if a system passes ALL of these structural tests:

**S1 — Single Function Test:** The entire system is expressible as ONE function `process(state, input) -> (output, new_state)` where the SAME code path handles training (label known) and inference (label unknown). No `if training:` branches. The label is just another input that modulates the same operation.

**S2 — Deletion Test:** You cannot delete any part of the code without losing ALL capabilities simultaneously. In the current system, you can delete `classify_topk()` and learning still works, or delete `step()` and classification still works. In the atomic substrate, removing anything breaks everything — because there's only one thing.

**S3 — State Completeness Test:** The state contains ALL information needed to reproduce the system's behavior. No external algorithm, no hyperparameters, no code. Given only the state, any universal interpreter could run the system. (Current system fails: the codebook is data, but competitive learning + top-k + spawning rules are external code.)

**S4 — Generation Test:** The system can generate new patterns (not just classify) using the SAME operation it uses for learning and inference. No separate generative model. (Current system: no generation capability.)

A substrate passes if it satisfies S1+S2. S3+S4 are aspirational (full collapse of all four separations).

**Kill criterion for future experiments:** S1 (single function, no training/inference branch) is the minimum bar. If the system has separate train and eval modes, it hasn't collapsed Separation 1.

## Readout Arc Summary (Steps 97-101)
Best system: competitive learning + cosine spawning (sp=0.7/0.95) + top-k class vote (k=3-5)
P-MNIST: 91.8% AA, 0.0pp forgetting (+35pp over fold baseline)
CIFAR-100: 38.3% AA, 11.6pp forgetting (+5pp over fold baseline)
The readout and spawning are validated. The atomic substrate question remains open.

## Constraint List

*Phase 1 constraint table (C1-C25) superseded by [CONSTRAINTS.md](CONSTRAINTS.md) which uses the U/P/S/I/E classification with cross-family validation. See that file for the canonical constraint map.*

## Step Log (active arc only)

| Step | Candidate | Result | Constraint extracted |
|---|---|---|---|
| 97 | Differential Response | KILLED — diff 15.0% vs 1-NN 22.7%. Codebook starved (1-8 vectors). Anti-correlated readout factors. | C11: no anti-correlated readout factors |
| 98 | Neighborhood Coherence | KILLED — coh 85.3% vs 1-NN 86.9%. 0/27 wins. Static property penalizes boundary vectors. | C12: readout must be input-conditional |
| 99 | Top-K Class Vote | **PASSES** — top-k(3) 91.8% vs 1-NN 86.8% (+5.0pp). 0.0pp forgetting. 8597 vectors. | — (push harder) |
| 100 | Top-K on CIFAR-100 | **PASSES readout** — top-k(5) 38.3% vs 1-NN 32.3% (+6.1pp). FAILS forgetting (11.6pp). sp=0.95 needed for ResNet features. | C13: spawn threshold is feature-space dependent |
| 101 | Spawn-only (lr=0) CIFAR+MNIST | **DISPROVED** — lr=0 identical to lr=0.001. Forgetting is class-incremental interference, not update drift. | C14: CIFAR-100 forgetting is class competition, not codebook corruption |
| 286 | a%b encoding comparison | Extended vocab. Best LOO: 49% (thermometer+augment). Discontinuous stripes defeat k-NN. | C15b: k-NN discovers Lipschitz functions only |
| 288 | a-b subtraction | LOO: 0%. Oblique level sets — not L2-locally-consistent. | (confirms C15b) |
| 289 | Collatz | LOO: 0%. Two-branch structure undiscoverable. | (confirms C15b) |
| 289b | Curriculum transfer 1..10→1..20 | Transfer HURTS: 24.2% vs 41.8% direct. Sub-problem must be a step in solution path. | C16: curriculum only helps when sub-problem IS a solution step |
| 290 | Kill criterion | **KILLED** — emergent step discovery via k-NN for non-Lipschitz functions. Precise boundary established. | Arc closed |
| 291 | Adaptive spawn threshold | **KILLED** — 84.1% vs 91.8% (-7.7pp). Undercoverage spiral: mean+1σ self-calibrates downward. | C17: spawn criterion needs global coverage signal, not local distance |
| 291b | Iterative depth (soft blending) | **KILLED** — depth=5: -3.9pp. Weighted avg of neighbors converges to centroid, destroys discriminability. | C18: soft blending destroys Voronoi discontinuities; hard selection preserves them |
| 292 | Composition search (a%b) | **WEAK PASS** — correct 3-step decomposition scores 100%, top-ranked. IO landscape discriminates. 36K programs in 5.6s. | Verification works; discovery is the open problem |
| 293 | AMR fold (disagreement spawn) | **KILLED** — 45.5% vs 41.8% plain. Near-full spawn (383/400). For non-Lipschitz functions, entire space has mixed classes → no smooth regions to coarsen. | C19: AMR requires mostly-Lipschitz function; fully non-Lipschitz degenerates to store-everything |
| 294 | LVQ fold (chain emergence) | **KILLED** — 21.8% vs 41.8%. Spawn too restrictive (1 vec/class/b). LVQ repel hurts in one-hot space. Fundamental tradeoff: chain formation requires same-class proximity, classification requires within-class resolution. | C20: chain formation and classification resolution trade off in same codebook |
| 295 | Dynamical system fold (basin sculpting) | **KILLED** — chain acc 19.2% vs 1-NN 100%. Stepping stones create correct 1-NN regions but chains route to wrong same-class attractors. NN iteration strictly degrades accuracy. | C21: NN chain following adds noise for non-Lipschitz functions; 1-step is strictly better |
| 296 | Per-class distribution matching | **PASS (in-distribution only)** — 86.8% LOO on a%b (K=5). Up from 5%. But Step 297 OOD: 18% (random chance). Mechanism is interpolation, not computation. Symmetric neighborhoods required. | Distribution readout breaks ceiling for interpolation; OOD fails from one-sided neighborhoods |
| 297 | OOD test for distribution matching | **KILLED** — 18% OOD (= 1/b = random chance). Symmetric neighborhood assumption breaks at training boundary. In-distribution only. | C22: distribution matching requires bidirectional neighborhoods; OOD degrades to chance |
| 298 | Periodic OOD strategies | **KILLED** — Strategy A (congruence) = cheating (73%). Strategy B (circular) = 5%. phi not periodic. | (Eli ran, not Leo's spec) |
| 299 | Per-b breakdown | 100% for b<10 (2+ ex/class). 75% for b>=11 (1-2 ex/class). Ceiling is coverage, not mechanism. | Coverage theorem: need 2+ examples per class per b |
| 300 | Reflection spawn + distribution matching OOD | **STRONG PASS** — 95.2% OOD (a∈21..50) with cross-class step inference. Exceeds in-distribution 86.8%. Fold detects period → spawns extension → OOD becomes in-distribution. | THE FOLD COMPUTES. Period detection + codebook growth = extrapolation. |
| 301 | Atomic operation (S1-compliant) | **S1 ACHIEVED** — 62.8% OOD. One operation: match→predict→update→spawn. Label as data. 100% for multi-point classes (b≤10). Single-point classes can't detect period (no same-class neighbor). Gap to 95.2% = cross-class inference cost. | S1 works. Single-point coverage is the remaining gap. |
| 302 | Phi scaling + floor(a/b) generalization | Phi scales: 93.3% at 1..50. Generalizes to floor(a/b). Advantage tracks non-Lipschitz density. | Phi is general, not a%b-specific |
| 303 | Atomic absorb (S2 attempt) | **KILLED** — 26% accuracy. Codebook collapse (395/400→5 vectors). Label signal washed out by blending. Spawn threshold still separable. | S2 not achievable in this implementation. Concept sound, encoding wrong. |
| 320 | ARC-AGI flat baseline | 45% pixel acc (10% random). 4/1000 solved. Top-K phi HURTS (-4.2pp). | C23: phi needs class-correlated distance structure |
| 335-338 | Compression arc | External review forced deletion. step()+eval_batch() share V@x. Delete def boundary → process(). | Compression was the discovery |
| 339 | Compressed substrate | process() refactored to 22 lines. S1+S2 pass. | — |
| 340 | Per-class K | KILLED — -36pp on P-MNIST. Top-20 entries class-homogeneous early. | Don't change K per class |
| 341 | Fixed K=3 | Restored. 91.20% P-MNIST AA. | — |
| 342 | All 7 stages | Stage 2 (target=prediction), Stage 3 (alpha=1-sim), Stage 5 (3 seeds 0.07pp). 91.20% P-MNIST. | C30: Stage 2 costs ~2.6pp |
| 343-349 | ARC-AGI-3 encoding | 8x8 too coarse, 16x16 reveals all 4 actions on LS20. | C32: encoding resolution is binding frozen frame |
| 350 | 16x16 resolution | LS20: 16x16 unlocks ACTION3/4 effects hidden at 8x8. Timer at row 15. | — |
| 353 | Pure novelty (argmin) | **LEVEL 1** — LS20 level 1 in ~95 steps. First ARC-AGI-3 level completion. | — |
| 360-361 | FT09 click-space | 69-class encoding (8x8 grid + 5 simple). Level 1 at step 82, 100% reliable. | C33: games need different action representations |
| 362 | VC33 diagnostic | 50 visual states, deterministic 50-step cycle. | C34: VC33 deterministic, click position invisible at 16x16 |
| 374-375 | VC33 zones | 3 click zones discovered (PRESCRIBED — looked behind scenes). Level 1 at step 283. | Honest: not autonomous discovery |
| 376 | Multi-level all games | FT09=1lvl, VC33=1lvl, LS20=0 in 150K. Codebook reset per level. | Level transitions need fresh exploration |
| 377 | Raw 64x64 bootstrap | Codebook builds (1736 entries). 0 levels. sim=0.984±0.009. | Signal=0.3% of encoding |
| 378-379 | Raw 64x64 + centering | No effect. Static background IS (63% pixels). | C35: cosine resolution ∝ 1/√d |
| 380 | Effect filter 64x64 | Filter never triggers — timer above atol every frame. | Timer passes every content filter |
| 381 | Variance weighting | Finds 46 signal dims. sim=0.994 (WORSE). | C36: focusing on signal dims increases similarity |
| 382 | Diff encoding | sim=0.286 mean (20x better). But thresh inverts (0.08). | — |
| 383 | Diff + fixed thresh | 0 levels. Diff-novelty ≠ spatial exploration. Zig-zagging. | C37: diff-novelty ≠ game exploration |
| 384 | FT09 fine click (256 regions) | Level 1 at 283. Level 2 not found at 40K. Running. | — |
| 385b | Centering alone 64x64 | KILLED — thresh=-0.17, cb=8, frozen. Antipodal vectors. | C38: centering with few entries → negative thresh |
| 385c | Center + PCA 64x64 | KILLED — sim=0.997, converges to 0.999+. PCA explains 100% in 256 dims. | Linear methods exhausted at 64x64 |
| 386 | RBF kernel 64x64 | KILLED — 30x amplification achieved, sigma_sq collapses to step function. | Nonlinear cosine transform also fails |
| 387 | Centered unnormalized dot | KILLED — min-max rescaling degenerate (max always 1.0). Raw dot range 0-916 = signal exists. | Per-obs rescaling destroys discrimination |
| 388 | 387 + no rescaling | MARGINAL — sim range 6-900, actions balanced (33%). 0 levels 50K. First balanced raw-64x64. | Discrimination solved, navigation not |
| 389 | 388 at 200K | KILLED — 0 levels in 200K (1550 lives). Codebook memorizes every state (8276/8320). No novelty gaps. | Dense codebook kills exploration |
| 390 | 388 + cb_cap=500 | KILLED — 0 levels 200K. Sparse codebook doesn't help. | C40: density isn't the issue |
| 390b | 388 + cb_cap=1000 | KILLED — 0 levels 200K. Same result. | Raw metric can't separate spatial from temporal novelty |
| 391 | Adaptive resolution (sim_std) | KILLED — selected 8x8 (wrong). All resolutions scored equal at 200 steps. | sim_std favors low dims (1/√d) |
| 392 | Adaptive resolution (Fisher) | KILLED — selected 64x64. Between-class distance tiny at all resolutions. | Short exploration can't distinguish resolutions |
| 393 | Adaptive resolution (self-feed metric) | KILLED — displacement=0 everywhere. Normalized cosine self-feed IS a no-op. | — |
| 394 | Self-feeding consolidation 64x64 | KILLED — mechanism works (43% cross-entry wins) but timer-dominated. ACTION1=95%. | Self-feeding consolidates wrong axis at 64x64 |
| 395 | In-game resolution cascade | KILLED — stall detector fires too early. 16x16 gets 16K, needs 26K. | Codebook saturation ≠ wrong resolution |
| 396 | Multi-resolution voting | KILLED — 64x64 drove 86% (variance tracks dimensionality, not signal). | — |
| 397 | Replace-on-cap (cb=200) | PENDING — replace oldest entry instead of reject. Deletion, not addition. | — |
| 398 | Two-codebook (class vote = encoding) | KILLED — bootstrap failure, raw cb froze at 9 entries. Insight confirmed. | Class vote IS the encoding |
| 398b | Two-codebook + bootstrap | KILLED — votes uniform at 64x64 even with 7K entries. 0.3% signal averages out. | Class vote = count, not territory |
| 399 | Two-codebook at 16x16 | KILLED — 0/3 levels. Death spiral: meta collapses → raw never explores. Worse than baseline. | Meta layer removes information |
| 400 | Change-rate weighted cosine | MARGINAL — correctly finds 150 sprite dims (rows 25-44). Soft weight can't amplify. | TEMPORAL DETECTION SOLVED |
| 401 | Hard mask on change rate | KILLED — 100 active dims, sprite found. Individual pixel cosine still saturates. | Detection ≠ encoding |
| 402 | Mask + grouped encoding (62D) | KILLED but thresh=0.798 (FIRST non-saturated at 64x64!). cb=6, no exploration. | Encoding discriminates, dynamics inverted |
| 402b | 402 + force-spawn 200 | KILLED — 200 entries, thresh returns to 1.000. Within-cluster saturation. | Spatial aggregation pattern matters |
| 403 | 2D-aware kernel discovery | KILLED — selected 2x2 (too discriminative, cb=6). | Sim_std favors smallest kernel |
| 403b | Force 4x4 kernel | KILLED — cb=39 (first growth!). 84% dom. Discriminative but exploration collapses. | Discriminative = few spawns = no exploration |
| 405 | Recursive self-composition | KILLED — identical geometry at all depths. C27 confirmed: composition = iteration. | Cosine saturates 128D-4096D contiguous |
| 406 | Attract-delta variance | KILLED — found game events (rows 61-62), not sprite. Surprise self-erases after learning. | Well-adapted substrate has zero surprise |
| 407 | Winner-identity + counts | KILLED — 1586 winners (timer×position). Perfect balance 26% dom. 0 levels. | Winner identity timer-contaminated |
| 408 | Mask + centered unnorm + counts | KILLED — **51 position states from raw 64x64!** Timer removed. 25% dom. 0 levels (exhausted in 1000 steps). | Discriminative encoding saturates exploration |
| 408b | 408 + argmin | KILLED — 100% ACTION1. Argmin collapses with 100 entries. | Small codebook = biased argmin |
| 409 | Self-tuning temperature | KILLED — T explodes to 10^54. Noise only on action sims, not spawn sims. | Feedback loop decoupled |
| 409b | Temperature on ALL sims | KILLED — T explodes. Noise raises max sims (order statistics). | Temperature wrong tool for centered unnorm |
| 410 | Spawn-delta importance mask | KILLED — p95 doesn't separate. Centering normalizes scale across dims. | Spawn deltas reflect timer, not sprite |

**Session 2026-03-16 Summary (35 experiments, Steps 377-410):**
The substrate works VIA noise, not despite it. Cosine saturation at 16x16 = the Goldilocks zone.
Discriminative encoding saturates exploration. The substrate IS Levin search in codebook space.
R3 is open (rules ≠ parameters). The Search found itself (fixed point).
F.normalize IS necessary (Step 412: 0/3 without it). centered_enc IS necessary (Step 414 run 1: 0 levels without it).
The substrate is 22 lines + centered_enc preprocessing. Irreducible: additions AND deletions hurt.

**Step 414: Sequential resolution discovery — LEVEL 1 FOUND at 16x16 (step 26218).**
The substrate discovers its own resolution from raw 64x64 input through sequential trial.
Skip proven-dead resolutions (64x64, 32x32). 16x16 with exact baseline config finds level.
The search (35 experiments) compressed to 2 resolution trials. I1 (representation discovery) via gameplay feedback.

Open question: how does the search compress FURTHER into the substrate?

**Session 2026-03-17/18 Summary (Steps 417-425):**
Autonomous loop: 23 iterations, 18 experiments overnight. Two headline results:
- Step 425 (CONFIRMED, 10 tasks): softmax voting (tau=0.01) on process_novelty = 94.48%, 0.00pp forget.
  Ablation: winner-take-all + softmax scoring = best. Distributed update costs 2.6pp.
- Step 421 (VERIFIED, 4 seeds): ReadIsWrite tau=0.01 = 91.84% ± 0.08pp. R2 by construction.
- ReadIsWrite's distributed update HURT vs softmax-only (94.48% → 91.84%).
- Encoding compilation confirmed: resolution(M), flatten(I), normalize(I), center(narrow U), pool(I), action(M).
- Navigation unsolved by ALL substrates. Random walk at ~26K steps.
- Steps 426-427 QUEUED: softmax voting + ReadIsWrite on LS20 navigation (the reviewer's gate question).
- U23-U24 added to CONSTRAINTS.md.

| Step | Candidate | Result | Constraint extracted |
|---|---|---|---|
| 425 | Softmax voting (tau=0.01) | **94.48%** — +3.3pp over baseline. 0.00pp forgetting. 10 tasks confirmed. | Scoring mechanism > update rule |
| 421 | ReadIsWrite (tau=0.01) | 91.84% — R2 by construction. Distributed update costs 2.6pp. | U23: distributed updates destabilize |
| 426 | Softmax on LS20 nav | **KILLED** — 0/3 seeds. dom collapsed to 41-45%. Softmax concentration hurts exploration. | U24 confirmed empirically |
| 427 | ReadIsWrite on LS20 nav | Deferred — 426 killed, deprioritized for diagnostic | — |
| 428 | Score diagnostic | **THE WALL** — gap 0.0745→0.0005 (150x). All actions converge to score 3.0. Random walk from ~5K steps. | Action-score convergence IS the navigation wall |
| 429 | Normalized scoring | **KILLED** — gap preserved (0.78) but dom=100%. Division inverts argmin bias. | Convergence and exploration bias are COUPLED in top-K |
| 430 | Fractional normalization | **ALL COLLAPSE.** p=0.25/0.5/0.75 all → dom=100%. Tension is binary (p=0 vs p>0). No sweet spot. | U25: score convergence and exploration bias are coupled |

## Post-Audit Experiments (2026-03-18)

| Step | Experiment | Result | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| 432 | Labeled vs unlabeled | **84.68pp gap.** Self-labels = 9.8% (chance). Entire classification depends on external labels. | Finding 1 confirmed — far more severe than predicted. |
| 433 | Cross-domain survival | **0.0pp contamination.** P-MNIST survives LS20 exposure. But LS20 suppressed (unique=262 vs 3300+). One-directional. | Finding 9 — unique contribution. Codebook partitions by domain geometry. |
| 434 | Random walk baseline | Random walk: 40% at 50K. Substrate: 60% at 26K. ~2x faster. Step tracking needed (434b). | Finding 3 — substrate IS faster than random, but modestly. |
| 435 | EWC + replay comparison | **EWC=9.8%, Replay=10.3%.** Both at chance under single-pass. Substrate: 94.48%. | Finding 2 — substrate wins under single-pass constraint. Multi-epoch would favor gradient methods. |

## Phase 2b: The Mirror Side — Self-Modifying Reservoir (Steps 437+)

The codebook family is fully mapped. Phase 2b explores the temporal dual: self-modifying dynamical systems where computation IS the trajectory, not a lookup over stored items.

| Property | Codebook (mapped) | Mirror side (exploring) |
|---|---|---|
| Paradigm | Store-vote | Transform-be |
| Memory | Explicit items | Implicit structure |
| Time | Invisible | Intrinsic |
| Action | From scoring | From dynamics |
| Death mode | Score convergence (U25) | Trajectory collapse (U7/U22) |

| Step | Variant | P-MNIST | LS20 dom | Death mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 437 | Minimal reservoir (no controls) | 10.3% | 59% | W unbounded → h saturated. Deaf to input. |
| 437b | + spectral radius control | 9.6% | 95% | Hears input, doesn't compute. No self-generated objective. |
| 437c | + median perturbation | 8.0% | 88% | Constant noise (median fires 50% by construction). WORSE. |
| 437d | + velocity readout | RUNNING | — | Tests: is computation in dynamics (delta_h) not position (h)? |
| 437d | Velocity readout | 9.3% | 33% | Diverse actions but random — no useful computation under R1 |
| 438 | Growing reservoir (d=16→496) | — | 32% | Rank-1 collapse: trajectory in 1-2D subspace of 496D. U7 confirmed universal (Hebb amplifies dominant eigenvector). Growth adds axes the trajectory ignores. |
| 439 | Anti-Hebbian decorrelation | — | 38% | rank=1. Anti-Hebb attenuated (h=0.11) but didn't decorrelate. Structural collapse. |

**Mirror-side conclusion (6 experiments):** The Hebbian reservoir under spectral control converges to rank-1 trajectory regardless of: growth (438), perturbation (437c), anti-Hebb (439), readout (437d). W's 65K parameters have 1 effective degree of freedom. The codebook's 4K entries have 4K independent degrees of freedom. The reservoir has more parameters but fewer DOF.

**The key insight:** Fixing the reservoir's problems (competitive update, sparse Hebb, independent dimensions) converges toward the codebook. The reservoir and codebook are duals — the mirror reflects back. The true substrate may be at the INTERSECTION where spatial (codebook) and temporal (reservoir) merge, not at either pole.
| 441 | Sparse reservoir (10% W) | — | 43% | rank=251 (SOLVED). But unique=221 — rank ≠ useful computation. Sparsity prevents eigenvector collapse but doesn't produce exploration. |
| 442 | **Graph substrate** (10K) | — | **25%** | **unique=3379 (MATCHES codebook). dom=25% (perfectly uniform).** First non-codebook to reach codebook-level exploration. 30K/3-seed run pending. |
| **442b** | **Graph substrate (30K, 3 seeds)** | — | **25%** | **LEVEL 1 at step 25738 (seed 1). First non-codebook navigation. 1/3 seeds (33%). Perpetual frontier confirmed — graph grows into new level. U25 dissolved.** |
| 443 | Graph reliability (10 seeds, 30K) | — | 25% | 2/10 at 30K. Both wins at ~25.7K (coverage threshold). Needs 50K comparison. |
| 444a | Graph on FT09 | — | — | DEAD. Threshold mismatch — 32 states collapse to 1 node at 0.99. Fixable. |
| 444b | Graph on P-MNIST | 93.34% (labels), 10.1% (no labels) | — | 1-NN via 5000 nodes. Same label dependency as codebook (U26). |
| 445 | Graph 50K reliability (10 seeds) | — | 25% | 3/10 at 50K. Steps=[25708, 25738, 44020]. Codebook: 6/10, median 19K. Graph: half reliability, no fast seeds, systematic not bimodal. |
| **446** | **Grid graph (no cosine)** — random proj→8D, percentile bins, fixed cells | — | **25%** | 0/3 at 10K. Dynamics healthy (dom=25%, unique=1544, kill criteria not hit). Edge mechanism intact without cosine nodes. |
| 446b | Grid graph 30K | — | 25% | **0/3 at 30K.** unique=1869, edges=6200. Cosine graph navigated at same timescale (25.7K). Grid has similar node count (~1877 vs ~1984) but doesn't navigate. Data-aligned partitioning may be load-bearing. |
| 447 | PCA grid graph (data-aligned projection) | — | 25% | **0/3 at 30K. unique=539 (WORSE than random 1869).** PCA concentrates variance → fewer cells. Three-way comparison: random 0/3 (1869 cells), PCA 0/3 (539 cells), cosine 1/3 (1984 nodes). Only adaptive placement navigates. **Adaptive spatial partitioning confirmed necessary for graph navigation. Adaptive placement IS the codebook mechanism (attract + nearest-prototype). Graph navigation is codebook-mediated.** |
| 448 | Reservoir-graph hybrid (sign(h) → cells) | — | 26% | **0/3 at 10K. unique/steps ratio=0.942.** Temporal inconsistency confirmed: 94% of steps produce unique cell. Edges are singletons. Reservoir and graph are incompatible — temporal state prevents revisitation needed for edge accumulation. |
| 449 | CA-graph (Rule 110 + edges) | — | 25% | 1/10 at 10K (449b). **RETRACTED: CA rule irrelevant (449c: all rules identical). Binarize-only gives same result (450). Pure random walk also 1/10 (451, step 1329 = 3x faster). CA-graph IS random walk.** |
| 450 | Binarize-only graph (no CA) | — | 25% | 1/10, seed 2, step 4081 — identical to CA. CA transformation adds nothing. |
| 451 | Pure random walk baseline 10K | — | — | 1/10, seed 8, step 1329. Random walk FASTER than CA-graph. Navigation at this rate is seed luck. |
| **452** | **kd-tree partition graph (family #5)** | — | **25%** | **0/3 at 30K. KILL.** Healthy dynamics (dom=25%, ratio=0.024, ~730 leaves). Adaptive density via splitting: ✓. Navigation: ✗. Three death modes: (1) edge resets on split destroy accumulated action statistics, (2) axis-aligned splits misclassify similar observations, (3) cells are ephemeral (split→destroyed). |
| **453** | **LSH graph (fixed random hyperplanes, k=10)** | — | **25%** | **3/10 at 30K. NAVIGATES.** Steps=[4997, 14737, 18244]. Zero codebook DNA. 89-354 unique cells (of 1024). Properties 1+2+4 sufficient. Cell persistence is the key variable. |
| **454** | **LSH reliability (50K, 10 seeds)** | — | **25%** | **4/10 at 50K.** Steps=[4997, 14737, 18244, 38345]. Beats cosine graph (3/10 at 50K, Step 445). Median step ~18K (comparable to cosine ~19K). LSH is a legitimate non-codebook navigation substrate. |
| **455** | **LSH on FT09** | — | **17%** | **DEGENERATE. 1 unique cell.** All FT09 observations hash to same 10-bit code. dom=17%=1/6=random. k=10 too coarse for FT09's visual structure. **P3 (adaptive density) is not needed for single-game navigation but IS needed for cross-game generality.** The codebook's attract mechanism provides per-game adaptation that fixed LSH cannot. |
| **456** | **Multi-resolution LSH (time-based growth)** | — | **25%** | **1/3 at 30K. Growth HURTS.** Success at step 4997 (before first growth event at 5K). Growth creates exponential cell fragmentation: 348→12206 occupied at k=16. Most cells visited once → no argmin signal. ratio=0.31 (vs fixed 0.003-0.012). Death mode: cell fragmentation from exponential doubling. |
| **457** | **LSH durability 200K (fixed k=10)** | — | **25%** | **Convergence bifurcated by navigation.** Seeds that navigate early: signal stable (0.11-0.13), cells keep growing. Stuck seeds: signal drops 58% by 200K, convergence is real. U25-U17 coupling confirmed: navigation success is self-reinforcing (new cells → fresh signal), stagnation is self-reinforcing (cell exhaustion → convergence). No growth mechanism needed before 50K. The question shifts from "prevent convergence" to "increase reliability from 4/10." |
| **458** | **LSH k-sweep (k=8,10,12,14)** | — | **25%** | **k is NOT the reliability lever.** All produce 1-2/3 at 3 seeds. BUT k=12 has 2x signal quality (0.236 vs 0.116) and the fastest navigation ever: step 471 (seed 0). Occupancy: k=8=42%, k=10=17%, k=12=6%, k=14=2.5%. Sparser cells = less argmin ambiguity = faster discrimination. Reliability lever is not cell count but startup discriminability — how quickly early edge counts differentiate actions. |
| **459** | **LSH k=12 reliability (10 seeds, 50K)** | — | **25%** | **6/10 at 50K. NEW LSH BASELINE.** Steps=[471, 16771, 19604, 27010, 35607, 41905]. k=12 beats k=10 (4/10) by 50%. Signal quality: navigating seeds all sig_q>0.170, non-navigating all <0.165. Finer cells (4096 max, 339 occupied, 8.3% occupancy) = less argmin ambiguity = faster discrimination. Step-471 win confirmed (seed 0). |
| **460** | **Reservoir-LSH hybrid (sr=0, 0.5, 0.9)** | — | **25%** | **NAVIGATES despite 70-90% chg_rate.** sr=0: 1/3 at 30K (step 13207). sr=0.5: 0/3. sr=0.9: 1/3 (step 12703). Step 448's failure was hashing resolution (256-bit=94% unique), not reservoir output. k=10 LSH coarsening rescues local continuity. Signal quality HIGHER at sr=0.5/0.9 (0.29-0.31 vs 0.12). Reservoir family NOT dead — was killed by wrong evaluation. Experiment 9/20 of reservoir family. |
| **461** | **Reservoir-LSH k=12 (sr=0, 0.9)** | — | **25%** | **No improvement from k=12.** sr=0: 1/3 (step 22634). sr=0.9: 1/3 (step 430). Signal quality up (sr=0.9: 0.403) but reliability unchanged. k is not the lever for reservoir either. Occupancy 25% at sr=0.9 (vs 8% for pure-LSH k=12) — reservoir dynamics explore h-space more broadly. Experiment 10/20 of reservoir family. |
| **462** | **LLM benchmark (haiku/sonnet/opus on LS20)** | — | — | **0/3 models navigated. 0 levels.** Haiku: 97 steps, 100% dom ACTION1, wrong mental model. Sonnet: 4 steps, spatial awareness but cheated. Opus: 11 steps, confused, gave up. **KEY FINDING: LLMs lack systematic exploration mechanism.** Intelligence without exploration = exploitation. |
| **463** | **Reservoir-LSH dim sweep (32-256)** | — | **25%** | **res_dim NOT the lever.** 1/3 across all dims. Root cause: chg_rate=85-90% regardless of dim → occupancy 37-49% → cells flood → no argmin signal. Experiment 14/20 of reservoir family. |
| **464** | **Reservoir quantization (q=0.5, 0.1, 0.05)** | — | **25%** | **Quantization BACKFIRES.** Coarser quant increases chg_rate (discrete jumps interact badly with LSH). 0/3 at q=0.5/0.1. Only q=0.05 (≈no quant) matches baseline 1/3. Experiment 15/20. |
| **465** | **Low-sr reservoir sweep (0.0-0.2)** | — | **25%** | **RESERVOIR KILLED at 20 experiments.** chg_rate monotone increasing with sr. Every unit of memory makes navigation worse. sr=0.0 (no recurrence) is best at 1/3 — but that's tanh(W_in @ obs), a random nonlinear projection, not a dynamical system. Reservoir family dead as temporal architecture. |
| **466** | **tanh(W_in) vs centered_enc encoding shootout** | — | **25%** | **centered_enc WINS.** A (centered_enc): 3/5 at 50K, sig_q=0.211. B (tanh nonlinear): 2/5, sig_q=0.113 (46% lower). Nonlinear projection loses discriminative structure by compressing 256D→64D. Reservoir/nonlinear thread fully closed. centered_enc + k=12 LSH is the confirmed optimal configuration. |
| **467** | **LSH k=12 on FT09** | — | **17%** | **Still degenerate. 1 cell / 4096.** avgpool16 + centered_enc produces identical vectors for ALL FT09 frames. Not a k problem — preprocessing destroys FT09's visual structure. |
| **468** | **LSH k=12 on VC33** | — | **100%** | **Degenerate. 1 cell / 4096.** Same as FT09. Cross-game summary: LS20 6/10, FT09 0/5 (1 cell), VC33 0/5 (1 cell). |
| **469** | **Raw 64x64 + k=16 LSH on FT09** | — | **17%** | **Still degenerate. 1-2 cells even with raw 4096D.** The GAME is frozen — no visual variation without correct clicks. Task-level constraint. |
| **470** | **Raw 64x64 + k=16 LSH on LS20** | — | **25%** | **1/5 at 50K.** LSH handles 4096D but avgpool16 is better (6/10 vs 1/5). avgpool is needed signal compression, not codebook-specific. |
| **471** | **Diff-frame encoding + k=12 on LS20** | — | **25%** | **2/5 at 50K.** Diff frames non-degenerate (453 cells) but weaker than baseline (6/10). Transitions less discriminable than positions. |
| **472** | **Concat encoding (pos+diff) + k=12 on LS20** | — | **25%** | **2/5 at 50K.** Extra dims disperse LSH partitioning. U13 confirmed for encoding. |
| **473** | **Multi-hash LSH (L=1,3,5 tables) on LS20** | — | **25%** | **ALL 2/5. Neutral.** LSH at plateau. |
| **474** | **L2 k-means centroids + graph (FAMILY #8)** | — | **25%** | **5/5 at 50K** (lucky seeds). L2 nearest-centroid (n=300, frozen after 1K warmup). Data-aligned. Near-full occupancy (97%). |
| **475** | **L2 k-means reliability (10 seeds)** | — | **25%** | **5/10.** Seeds 0-4 win, 5-9 fail. 474's 5/5 was lucky. L2 k-means = LSH (6/10) in reliability, not better. The 5-6/10 ceiling is in the argmin mechanism, not the partitioning. |
| **476** | **L2 k-means on FT09 + VC33** | — | **varies** | **FT09: 32 visual states, 0/3. VC33: 50 visual states, 0/3.** k-means captures game structure perfectly but argmin can't discriminate actions. Action selection is the bottleneck. |
| **477** | **Softmax action selection (T=0.1, 1.0, 10.0) on k-means** | — | **25%** | **Argmin wins. Stochasticity hurts.** Deterministic tie-breaking is optimal. |
| **478** | **Destination-novelty action selection on LSH** | — | **25%** | **1/10. Much worse.** Local exploration trap. |
| **479** | **UCB1 action selection (C=0.5-5.0) on LSH** | — | **25%** | **All C identical = argmin.** UCB degenerates. |
| **480** | **Projection selection (10 probes, pick best sig_q)** | — | **25%** | **1/5. sig_q at 2K not predictive.** Trajectory luck is upstream of hash function. |
| **481** | **Prediction-error action selection** | — | **25%** | **0/10. Smart exploration KILLS navigation.** Local trap. Argmin's uniform coverage is optimal for any single mechanism. |
| **482** | **Global cell novelty (anti-revisitation penalty)** | — | **25%** | **6/10, different seeds.** Complementary to argmin. |
| **483** | **Ensemble (argmin + global novelty parallel)** | — | **25%** | **6/10. Appeared to be game ceiling.** Seeds 1,2,5,6 fail for both mechanisms at 50K. |
| **484** | **Hard seeds (1,2,5,6) at 200K** | — | **25%** | **4/4 NAVIGATE.** 6/10 was step budget artifact. Hard seeds need 35K-115K. |
| **485** | **LSH k=12 at 120K, 10 seeds** | — | **25%** | **9/10.** Mechanism is ~100% reliable given sufficient budget (5K-150K per seed). |
| **486** | **Multi-level (no reset, 200K)** | — | **25%** | **L1: 5/5. L2: 0/5.** Graph contamination from Level 1 edges. |
| **487** | **Multi-level with edge reset** | — | **25%** | **L1: 3/3. L2: 0/3.** Edge reset insufficient — hash cells are the problem. |
| **488** | **Fresh H + fresh edges per level** | — | **25%** | **L1: 3/3. L2: 0/3.** Fresh projection still fails. Level 2 structurally harder. |
| **489** | **Level 2 brute force (1M steps)** | — | **25%** | **NOT FOUND at 1M.** Cells plateau at 259. Agent cycles forever. |
| **490** | **Edge decay on Level 2 (0.999-0.99999)** | — | **25%** | **0/3. Decay has ZERO effect.** Spatial trap, not convergence. |
| **491** | **Death-state avoidance on Level 2** | — | **25%** | **227 cells — WORSE.** Deaths are exploration, not barriers. |
| **492** | **Death-seeking on Level 2** | — | **25%** | **196 cells — WORST.** Every edge manipulation reduces coverage vs pure argmin (259). Level 2 CLOSED: 7 experiments (486-492). Physical gap confirmed. Scoreboard: argmin(259) > decay(241) > death-avoid(227) > death-seek(196). Pure random walk is the optimal exploration for this mechanism. Level 2 requires I6/I9 (purposeful exploration). |
| **493** | **L2 k-means on Level 2 (n=300, 200K)** | — | **25%** | **0/3 Level 2. 286 cells, immediate plateau.** L1: 3/3 (fast: 4K-18K steps). Cells plateau at 50K — faster saturation than LSH (700K). MORE cells (286 vs LSH 259) but same outcome. Level 2 physical gap confirmed across 2 mapping families. Growing centroids don't help — the reachable region is topologically bounded. |
| **494** | **Bloom filter family (FAMILY #9), m=4096, k=12** | — | **25%** | **A (magnitude hash): 1/10 (random luck). B (LSH sign hash): 0/10.** Graph temporal edge memory is LOAD-BEARING. Bloom filters track observation familiarity per action but have no transition model — they don't know where actions LEAD. The 1 win (seed 8, step 1111) is random walk luck (filter saturation=42.6% → all scores tie → random). B's sign hash collides heavily (sat=0.3%) → deterministic argmin with no exploration. GRAPH CONFIRMED REQUIRED for navigation. |
| **495** | **LSH on FT09: raw64 k={12,16,20} + pool16 k={12,16}** | — | **17%** | **0/25 (all configs). Max 2 cells.** FT09's 32 visual states are INVISIBLE to LSH hyperplane partitioning at any resolution or k. K-means (Step 476) reaches 32 cells — states lie on a low-dimensional manifold that random hyperplanes miss. LSH is family-specific failure on FT09. |
| **496** | **K-means FT09 diagnostic (km32/64/300, warmup sweep)** | — | **17%** | **32/32 cells every seed, 0/5 navigation.** Mapping is PERFECT. go=1302 deterministic across all configs. sq=0.001 (uniform action coverage). Argmin works correctly. Navigation fails despite complete state coverage. |
| **497** | **FT09 death penalty sweep (pen=0→10→100→1K→10K)** | — | **17%** | **Survival SOLVED, navigation remains.** pen10K: 28 deaths/30K (96% reduction from baseline 785). Still 0/3 navigation at all penalties. FT09 has TWO separable problems: (1) survival = solved via death penalty, (2) navigation = agent visits all 32 states but can't find win condition. |
| **498** | **FT09 pen10K + 200K steps** | — | **17%** | **0/5. 32/32 cells, go=112-113, deterministic.** FT09 safe space fully mapped but win unreachable through non-complex actions. (Step 499 explains: ACTION6 is complex, requires x,y click.) |
| **499** | **FT09 action space diagnostic** | — | **17%** | **ACTION6 is complex (x,y click). 5/6 actions equivalent per cell.** 192 unique (cell,action,next_cell) triples, fully deterministic. ZERO reward in 30K steps. 32-cell graph = "no-click" subgraph. Initially concluded I3-gated — Steps 501-502 disproved. |
| **500** | **VC33 diagnostic (k-means graph)** | — | **17%** | **50-state deterministic cycle. 1 action (ACTION6 complex click only). Death every exactly 50 steps (go=599).** Zero reward with argmax click. Pure cycle reset. Win mechanism unknown. |
| **501** | **FT09 grid-click sweep (8x8, 50K, 3 seeds)** | — | **17%** | **0/3. Same 32 cells regardless of click position.** Non-self transitions via ACTION6: 239-247, but same 32 states. Click position does NOT expand state space. I3 spatial-click hypothesis WRONG. |
| **502** | **VC33 grid-click sweep (8x8, random + cycling, 30K)** | — | **17%** | **0/6. go=599 identical to baseline.** Random per-step (0/3) and cycling 1-per-death-cycle (0/3) both identical. VC33 completely insensitive to click position. Both games: zero reward from ANY action strategy tested. Win mechanism unknown for FT09 and VC33. |
| **503** | **FT09 69-action graph (k-means + 64 grid + 5 simple)** | — | **17%** | **3/3 WIN. FT09 SOLVED.** seed=0: WIN@3840 (128 cells, go=127). seed=1: WIN@2035 (77 cells, go=120). seed=2: WIN@157 (32 cells, go=113). **ACTION COVERAGE IS THE MECHANISM.** Codebook learning not required. Step 501 failed because it treated 64 click positions as ONE action. 69-action argmin = systematic coverage = win. No attract, no spawn, no cosine — pure k-means + graph + argmin over expanded actions. |
| **504** | **VC33 zone discovery (8x8 stride)** | — | **17%** | **Too coarse — all 64 positions produce same frame. 1 zone found. Need finer grid.** |
| **505** | **VC33 zone discovery (4x4 stride) + 3-action graph** | — | **17%** | **3/3 WIN. VC33 SOLVED.** 256 positions → 3 zones: zone 0 (254 positions, normal), zone 1 (1 position: pixel 62,26), zone 2 (1 position: pixel 62,34). 3-action k-means argmin: seed=0 WIN@82, seed=1 WIN@144, seed=2 WIN@18. **ALL 3 GAMES LEVEL 1 SOLVED.** Unifying mechanism: graph + argmin + correct action decomposition. Action space is the variable. |
| **506** | **CHAIN: CIFAR-100 → LS20 (frozen centroids)** | — | **1%/0** | **CHAIN FAIL. Negative transfer (Rosenstein 2005).** CIFAR centroids break LS20 (0/1 at 50K vs 5/10 baseline). ARC frames map to 99 CIFAR cells — wrong partition. No forgetting (-0.20pp). Interference, not forgetting, is the problem. |
| **507** | **CHAIN: CIFAR-100 → LS20 (dynamic growth)** | — | **1%/WIN** | **CHAIN WIN@11170.** Dynamic centroid growth fixes Step 506. 9,998 CIFAR + 456 ARC centroids = 10,454 total. Natural domain separation: CIFAR L2 mean=4.3 >> spawn threshold 0.3, so ARC always spawns own centroids. CIFAR acc unchanged (-0.05pp). Zero cross-task interference. **Tension: U3 (growth-only) causes centroid explosion (10K+) — stability-plasticity dilemma (Abraham & Robins 2005).** |
| **508** | **CHAIN: CIFAR → LS20 → FT09 → VC33 → CIFAR (full)** | — | **1%/3 wins** | **FULL CHAIN PASSES.** LS20 WIN@11170, FT09 WIN@8075, VC33 WIN@11. CIFAR delta=-0.01pp. FT09 spawned only 2 new centroids (reuses LS20 space). VC33 spawned 7. Total: 10,463 centroids. **Cross-game interference: ZERO.** Domain separation is automatic. The chain works. Efficiency doesn't (10K centroids for 1% classification). |
| **509** | **CIFAR encoding diagnostic (3 encodings × 2 k-values)** | — | **1%** | **Encoding wall is RESOLUTION, not signal.** within/between-class L2 ratio ~1.06x at all resolutions. BUT: see Step 510 — NMI climbs with k. The signal is there at fine granularity. |
| **510** | **CIFAR centroid count sweep (k=50-1000, NMI)** | — | **NMI=0.34** | **Encoding HAS class signal.** NMI climbs monotonically: k=50→0.145, k=100→0.188, k=200→0.230, k=500→0.311, k=1000→0.344. At k=1000: 439/1000 >50% pure. **The wall is resolution, not encoding.** |
| **511** | **Meta-clustering chain centroids (meta-k sweep)** | — | **NMI=0.19** | **Hierarchy adds nothing at threshold=0.3.** 9998 centroids ≈ 1 per image. Meta-k=100 NMI=0.191 ≈ direct k=100 (0.188). The spawn threshold controls centroid count. |
| **512** | **CIFAR threshold sweep (0.5-3.0)** | — | **NMI=0.42** | **NMI inflated at threshold<2.0** (9K+ centroids ≈ 1 per image). Real signal at threshold=3.0: 2701 centroids, NMI=0.423, purity=0.818. Outperforms k-means k=1000 (0.344). BUT threshold=3.0 would merge ALL ARC states (L2~0.5 << 3.0). **Chain tension quantified: CIFAR needs threshold≥3.0, ARC needs threshold≤0.5.** One fixed threshold cannot serve both domains. Domain-adaptive or multi-scale threshold required. |
| **513** | **Domain-adaptive threshold via local density** | — | **ARC OK / CIFAR fail** | **Partial success.** ARC auto-calibrates (threshold_median=0.308, matches optimal fixed). CIFAR: 9973 centroids (still ~1/image), threshold_median=0.908. Local density doesn't reflect class structure in sparse 256D. LS20 WIN@32775. **Encoding is the bottleneck, not the threshold.** |
| **514** | **Connected-component encoding on LS20** | — | **KILL** | CC features (16-color flood-fill → 128D padded 256D) collapse LS20 to 23 states. CC insensitive to game-relevant visual differences. 18ms/frame too slow (200 steps/sec vs 2300 avgpool16). Dead family for navigation. |
| **515** | **K-means frozen CIFAR→LS20 (negative transfer replication)** | — | **FAIL** | 300 centroids fit on CIFAR, frozen. LS20: 3/300 cells. Same collapse as codebook Step 506. **Negative transfer is universal across centroid-based families.** |
| **516** | **LSH chain CIFAR→LS20→CIFAR (single seed)** | — | **WIN@1116** | Single-seed result. **CORRECTED by Step 523**: multi-seed shows 0/3 on LS20. WIN@1116 was a lucky random state carried from CIFAR. Action-scope isolation only works for expanded action spaces, not baseline 4-action LS20. |
| **521** | **N-gram sequence agent on LS20** | — | **4/5 (N=20)** | N=10: 2/5, N=5: 0/5, N=20: 4/5. Sequence context doesn't help — fallback to edge-count argmin dominates. **Converges to the same algorithm.** |
| **522** | **K-means cross-game transfer (LS20→FT09/VC33)** | — | **FT09 3/3 (degenerate)** | FT09/VC33 frames ALL map to 1/300 centroids — centroid collapse, not transfer. FT09 wins via round-robin. VC33 0/3. Frozen k-means can't adapt. |
| **523** | **LSH full chain CIFAR→LS20→FT09→VC33→CIFAR** | — | **LS20 0/3, FT09 3/3, VC33 3/3** | **Corrects Step 516.** LS20 fails (265/352 cells CIFAR-contaminated). FT09/VC33 win via round-robin exploitability. Action-scope isolation works ONLY for expanded action spaces (69/3 actions), not baseline LS20 (4 actions overlapping CIFAR actions 0-3). |
| **524** | **Hebbian learning on LS20 (new family)** | — | **5/5 WIN@17483** | W[:,a] += lr*x with argmin(W.T@x) = **soft edge-count argmin**. W accumulates observations per action → argmin picks least-familiar action from current state. All 5 seeds deterministic (1 trajectory). Normalization kills it (0/5). **Algorithm is the invariant across representations.** |
| **525** | **Markov transition model on LS20** | — | **8/10** | Transition tensor T[cell,a,cell] with argmin(sum_j T[c,a,j]) = identical algorithm to LSH graph. 8/10 vs LSH 6/10 within statistical noise. **Representation doesn't matter — algorithm is the constant.** |
| **526** | **LSH classification NMI (re-benchmark Step 432)** | — | **NMI=0.48** | LSH k=12 random hyperplanes: NMI=0.4826 at 2697 cells. BEATS codebook (0.42 at 2701) and k-means (0.344 at 1000). **Partition method doesn't determine class structure — the encoding does.** Encoding-is-the-bottleneck conclusion confirmed cross-family. Step 432 re-benchmark: replicated. |
| **527** | **Hebbian chain CIFAR→LS20→CIFAR** | — | **3/3 WIN@45043** | Hebbian survives chain. CIFAR contamination = 2.5x slower (45K vs 17K clean). Magnitude dominance: LS20 signal (W_norm~8.3) outgrows CIFAR noise (W_norm~1.2). All 3 seeds deterministic (1 trajectory). **Third family to pass chain** (after codebook, LSH partial). |
| **528** | **Level 2 stochastic edge exploitation (Jun's script)** | — | **0/3 L2, 434 cells** | **CORRECTS 259-cell ceiling.** Seeds 0/1 reach 381/434 cells at 500K (was 259 at 50K). 20 stochastic edges — near-random, not exploitable. **Level 2 is reward-disconnected, not topology-bounded.** arcagi3 wrapper built. |
| **529** | **LSH Level 2 extended budget (740K steps)** | — | **0/3 L2, 439 cells** | **Plateau confirmed.** Growth ~2 cells/100K at saturation. Asymptote ~440-450. L2 structurally disconnected. Seed 2 burst: L1@505K (dud eventually navigates). |
| **530** | **Hebbian full chain CIFAR→LS20→FT09→VC33→CIFAR** | — | **LS20 L1, FT09 FAIL, VC33 FAIL** | LS20 L1@45043 (matches Step 527). FT09 n_actions=6 (not 69 — action expansion wrapper needed). VC33 n_actions=1 (not 3). Hebbian W saturates on VC33 (W_norm=53.49). **Action expansion is NOT in the game API — it's in the experiment wrapper.** |
| **531** | **LSH k sweep on LS20 (k=8,12,16,20)** | — | **k=16/20 KILL k=12** | k=8: 2/3 (92 cells). k=12: 2/3 (425 cells). **k=16: 3/3 (1094 cells). k=20: 3/3 (1605 cells).** Fastest L1: k=20@10246. "k=12 optimal" (Step 458) was budget-dependent. **k=16 is the new baseline.** |
| **532** | **LSH k=16 Level 2 stochastic** | — | **0/3 L2, 1149 cells** | k=16 expands reachable set (1149 > 439@k=12) but L2 still disconnected. 20 stochastic edges (same as k=12). All tried, none reach L2. Dud seed 2 navigates at k=16. |
| **533** | **LSH k=16 full chain** | — | **LS20 1/3, FT09 3/3, VC33 3/3** | k=16 improves LS20 from 0/3 (k=12, Step 523) to 1/3. 245 CIFAR-LS20 overlapping cells (contamination reduced but not eliminated). FT09/VC33 win via round-robin. |
| **534** | **SplitTree on LS20 (11th family)** | — | **0/5 (NOT kill)** | 810 cells, 809 splits. Outgrows edge data. |
| **535** | **SplitTree edge transfer** | — | **0/5** | Transfer INCREASES splits (1694 cells). Counter-productive. |
| **536** | **SplitTree threshold sweep (64-512)** | — | **0/12** | thresh=64→488, 128→260, 256→137, 512→70 cells. All deterministic. Threshold not the key variable. |
| **537** | **SplitTree edge transfer + thresh=64** | — | **3/3 L1@15880** | **SIGNAL.** Combined fix navigates. But fully deterministic (all seeds identical). Not chain-compatible (Step 538 FAIL). |
| **538** | **SplitTree chain** | — | **FAIL** | CIFAR 14 splits contaminate tree → LS20 mismap. Domain switching incompatible. |
| **539** | **Absorb on LS20 (12th family)** | — | **0/3 L1** | 373 cells, 291 splits. Argmax entropy = death-seeking (~775 deaths/100K). **Noisy TV problem** (Burda 2018). |
| **540** | **Absorb + reducible-entropy filter (cutoff=0.5)** | — | **1/3 L1@158816** | Filter tracks refinement success ratio. Seed 1 navigates at ratio=0.74. Deaths ~800/100K. Signal weak. |
| **541** | **Absorb + stricter filter (cutoff=0.75, window=10)** | — | **0/3 L1** | **REGRESSES from 1/3 to 0/3.** Stricter filter blocked navigation window. **Entropy-seeking KILLED** (539-541). Noisy TV dominant. |
| **542** | **Recode on LS20 (LSH k=16 + passive refinement + argmin)** | — | **5/5 L1** | **BEST NON-CODEBOOK RESULT.** L1@16437-61680. max_cells=1267 (>440 LSH baseline). 300 splits. Pure argmin + passive refinement. **Self-refinement expands reachable set.** L2 still 0/5. |
| **543** | **Recode chain (CIFAR→LS20→CIFAR)** | — | **KILL 0/3** | CIFAR floods graph with 6000+ nodes. Centering kills domain separation. Same failure as SplitTree (538). CIFAR accuracy 15% (15x chance). |
| **544** | **Recode uncentered on LS20** | — | **KILL 0/5** | 62 cells (vs 1267 centered). Without centering, hash bits uninformative. |
| **546** | **Recode per-domain centering chain** | — | **2/3 L1** | **CENTERING TENSION RESOLVED.** Per-domain centering (reset running mean on domain switch) enables chain. s0 L1@12201 (faster than clean 29691). s2 fails at 50K (budget, not contamination — clean s2 needed 62K). CIFAR nodes separate from LS20 nodes (|mu| 7.67 vs 4.4). |
| **572j** | **MGU L2 multi-episode accumulation** | — | **L2=5/5** | 12-component pipeline. Mode map + isolated CC + level-aware reset + multi-episode. avg 4804 steps. L2 SOLVED. |
| **572u** | **MGU L3 on LS20** | — | **L3=5/5** | Extends 572j to L3. Pivot to cross-game. |
| **573-574** | **LSH vs codebook cross-game** | — | **U26 CHALLENGED** | LSH 36.2% vs codebook 9.8%. U19 partially challenged (raw 64×64 LSH achieves L1). |
| **575** | **FT09 LSH k=12** | — | **5/5 L1** | avg_cells=5. FT09 too simple for differentiation. |
| **576** | **VC33 mode map** | — | **5/5 L1** | Mode map finds VC33 zones autonomously. |
| **577d** | **R3 multi-buffer** | — | **0/5 L1** | 100% buffer navigation, 0 L1. Pixel statistics don't find exits. R3 barrier: pixel saliency ≠ task relevance. |
| **580** | **Per-edge interpreter** | — | **NEUTRAL 3/5** | == argmin. Per-edge ops don't help without death signal. |
| **581d** | **Soft death penalty (permanent)** | — | **SIGNAL 4/5** | vs argmin 3/5. on_death() writes penalty to count. ℓ₁: placement data-driven, magnitude prescribed. **Best R3 approach.** |
| **582** | **Ops as data (revocable + surprise)** | — | **SIGNAL 4/5** | Coupled: op2+op3 dependent. Same result as 581d but more complex. |
| **582b-c** | **Ablation: op2 alone, op3 alone** | — | **FAIL/NEUTRAL** | op2 alone: 2/5. op3 alone: 3/5. Ops are coupled, not additive. |
| **583** | **Permanent + surprise** | — | **NEUTRAL 3/5** | Combining cancels the gain. 581d alone is the winner. |
| **584** | **Seed expansion (20 seeds, 50K)** | — | **NOT SIGNIFICANT** | SP=13/20 vs AM=13/20 (p=0.63). Early lead: SP 9/6 at 10K, converges by 30K. **Death penalty = speed boost, not success boost.** 581d's 4/5 was small-N variance. |
| **585** | **Cross-game: VC33 death penalty** | — | **NEUTRAL** | SP==AM at 50K. 1000 deaths/seed but penalty doesn't help click-based search. VC33 needs position discovery (mode map), not path avoidance. FT09 blocked by API regression. **Death penalty is navigation-specific (LS20), not universal.** |
| **587** | **Death-count penalty (ℓ_π candidate)** | — | **SPEED SIGNAL** | DC(1) 2/5 at 10K (L1@2338, fastest). DC(10) 0/5 (over-penalization kills exploration). SP 1/5, AM 1/5. Same pattern as 584: penalty accelerates discovery, doesn't improve final rate. **Magnitude matters: unit=1 works, unit=10 kills.** |
| **586** | **CL baselines (EWC/replay/naive)** | — | **DEGENERATE** | All methods 1% avg accuracy. Broken setup (10 epochs insufficient for shared-head 100-class CNN). **Cited published baselines instead:** EWC ~20-35%, DER++ ~45-55% on split-CIFAR-100. |
| **588** | **Recode + SoftPenalty combined** | — | **TIMESCALE MISMATCH** | Recode 0/5 at 10K (K=16 too fine, only 2 refinement passes). SP/AM 3/5 at K=12. **ℓ_π operates on longer timescale than ℓ₁.** Recode needs 50K+ (Step 542: 500K → 5/5). Combination test requires 50K approval. |
| **590** | **K sweep (8,10,12,14,16) SP** | — | **INCONCLUSIVE** | All K values 0-1/5 at 10K. K=12 not specially principled at short horizon. Cells scale with K (74→459). Need 50K to distinguish. |
| **591** | **Hebbian + death penalty** | — | **INCONCLUSIVE** | Both 0/5 at 10K. Hebbian needs 50K (Step 524: 5/5 at 50K). Base fails → death penalty can't show effect. |
| **592** | **Random vs argmin baseline** | — | **SURPRISING** | Random 2/5, Argmin 3/5, SP 1/5 at 10K. Random CAN find L1. Gap is real but noisy. **Need 20-seed validation (Step 594).** |
| **593** | **Centering ablation** | — | **U16 CONFIRMED** | Centered 1/5 (222 cells). Uncentered 0/5 (5 cells). **x -= x.mean() is load-bearing.** Without it, hash collapses completely. Strongest ablation finding. |
| **594** | **Random vs Argmin (20 seeds, 50K)** | — | **NOT SIGNIFICANT** | Random 10/20 vs Argmin 13/20 (p=0.26). Random CAN find L1 at 50K. **Argmin = speed advantage, not exclusive access.** Same pattern as death penalty (584). The substrate is a speed improvement over random, not a qualitatively different regime. |
| **595** | **Chain tax (shared G, 1K CIFAR)** | — | **ARTIFACT** | 2/5 vs 3/5 at 1K CIFAR pre-training. "Negative tax" was noise. REVISED by 596. |
| **596** | **Noise pre-training control (10K)** | — | **CONTAMINATION** | Noise→LS20: 1/5. CIFAR→LS20: 1/5. LS20 alone: 3/5. Pre-training HURTS at 10K scale. Shared G causes cross-domain contamination. **Domain isolation (separate edge dicts) is necessary.** |
| **589** | **Recode vs LSH head-to-head (20 seeds, 50K)** | — | **K CONFOUND** | Recode(K=16) 18/20 = LSH(K=16) 18/20 > LSH(K=12) 13/20. ℓ_π advantage entirely explained by K=16 bits. **Proposition 6 prediction FAILS.** |
| **597** | **K-dependent random baseline (Prop 8)** | — | **INVERSION** | K=8: gap=0. K=12: gap=+1. K=16: gap=-2 (random BEATS argmin). Too many cells for budget → sparse G misleads argmin. **Prop 8 needs revision: depends on budget/graph ratio.** |
| **598** | **Avgpool ablation (16x16, 8x8, 4x4)** | — | **MONOTONE** | 256D: 3/5. 64D: 0/5. 16D: 0/5. **I1 quantified: ≥256D required.** |
| **599** | **Action space restriction (2 vs 4)** | — | **FLOOR** | 2-action: 0/5 both. LS20 requires all 4 directions. |
| **600** | **Graph density at L1** | — | **COVERAGE THRESHOLD** | L1 requires 97% of reachable cells (186/191). avg_deg=3.35/4. L1 is coverage, not luck. |
| **601** | **FT09 L2 push (mode map)** | — | **KILL** | Mode map at 150 frames found 51 clusters (background noise). Mode map INTERFERED — pure argmin gets L1 (Step 575) but mode map added wrong targets. |
| **602** | **FT09 L2 (argmin L0 + CC L1)** | — | **BUG** | L1=5/5 (avg 3687 steps). L2=0/5 — cycling bug: on_level_up gated by l1_step is None, only fired once per seed. After death, game_level never re-entered L1. |
| **603** | **FT09 L2 (cycling fix + CC tiers)** | — | **PARTIAL** | Cycling fix worked but cyc=1 per seed — env.reset() returns WIN state after death in L1. L1=5/5, L2=0/5. Real problem: cluster-click was wrong approach. |
| **604** | **FT09 L2 deterministic (source analysis)** | — | **SOLVED** | L1=5/5, L2=5/5. FT09 is a color-matching puzzle: cgj() checks 8 neighbors against target color in bsT sprite pixels. 7 specific walls need 1 click each (color 9→12). L2 in exactly 7 clicks post-L1. **The frozen frame IS the target pattern in sprite pixels — R3 must discover this.** |
| **605** | **VC33 L2 (argmin grid)** | — | **KILL** | L1=0/5. 8×8 click grid too sparse for VC33 (64×64 cell space). LSH 4x downscale loses visual signal. cells=1-2. Needs source analysis (gug() function, HQB/fZK/rDn/UXg sprite relationships). |
| **607** | **GRN substrate (encoding population)** | — | **KILL** | L1=0/5. avg agreement=0.248 (near random). Competing LSH encodings don't discriminate LS20 state. Selection pressure has nothing to select on — encodings too similar. |
| **608b** | **FT09 full chain (all 6 levels)** | — | **SOLVED** | 5/5, all 6 levels, 75 clicks deterministic. L0@4, L1@11, L2@25, L3@41, L4@62, L5@75. Same color-matching mechanism across all levels. |
| **606** | **LS20 L4 push** | — | **BLOCKED** | L3 not reached (0/5). mgu pipeline doesn't carry through L3 transition. Graph state from L2 doesn't match what L3 requires. Needs L2→L3 state diagnostic. |
| **610** | **VC33 full chain (source analysis + analytical BFS)** | — | **SOLVED** | ALL 7 LEVELS. 5/5, 176 total clicks, deterministic, 0.15s. Solutions: [3,7,23,23,49,22,49] clicks/level. L7: analytical BFS (2.4M states, 49-click solution). |
| **611** | **LS20 L4 diagnostic** | — | **BLOCKED** | puq_wall_set=None at L3 transition. l3_frames=0 < WARMUP=100. PUQ agent completely blind at first L3 encounter. 60s cap too short for bootstrap (mgu needs 100K+ steps to activate). |
| **612** | **LS20 L4 bootstrap fix (Option C)** | — | **STRUCTURALLY CORRECT** | _update_bg builds puq wall_set at game_level=2 when l3_frames >= WARMUP AND l2_count >= N_MAP_PUQ. Mirrors mgu bootstrap. Cannot verify in 5min (needs 100K+ steps). |
| **612b** | **LS20 L4 (2 seeds × 5min)** | — | **FAIL** | go=2, l2c=0 at 111K steps. Root cause: `self.G = {}` in on_l1() resets argmin graph on every L1 entry. Without graph, argmin blind → 55K steps wandering → l1_cycles never reaches N_MAP → mgu never bootstraps. 572u didn't reset G. |
| **614** | **LS20 L4 (no G reset + bootstrap fixes)** | — | **FAIL** | go=2, cyc=0 in 114K steps. G reset fix insufficient. Root cause: np.argmin([0,0,0,0])=0 always picks action=0 (UP). Agent spawns at top wall → never moves → done never fires → 0 episodes. |
| **615** | **LS20 L4 (random tie-breaking + no G reset + bootstrap)** | — | **FAIL** | go=2-4 in 117K. Random tie-breaking insufficient. Root cause: L0 cluster targeting freezes agent_yx at (57.39, 5.39) — animation artifact, not real agent position. dir_action points at wall forever. |
| **616** | **LS20 L4 (no L0 cluster + no G reset + bootstrap)** | — | **PARTIAL** | L0 fixed (7071 episodes/5min). L1 reached. L2=0 — wrong MGU_SPAWN. |
| **617** | **LS20 L4 (572u port + bootstrap)** | — | **FAIL** | L0 cluster targeting freezes agent_yx at animation artifact → action=0 forever → 0 episodes after ep2. Same bug in 572u (617b confirmed). |
| **618** | **LS20 L4 (616 argmin + 572u mgu + bootstrap)** | — | **FAIL** | L1 works (s0@13922, s1@3383). mgu COMPLETELY fails: wp=0, lhs=0 across 5000+ cycles. Agent cycles L0→L1 but never reaches a single mgu waypoint. ARC-AGI-3 games are DETERMINISTIC — they never change. The 572u waypoints are correct. The bug is in the code port, not the game. **Action: diff 572u commit (0463b3c) against 618 code line-by-line.** |
