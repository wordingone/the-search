## The Search Is a Composition Loop

The search finds substrates by composing validated components, testing against developmental stages, identifying the failing stage, finding or building the component for that stage, and composing again.

**Unit of search:** a composition of components, not an individual substrate.
**Architecture:** allosteric  - encoding and action selection share parameters (W).
**Test framework:** stages I3, I1, I4, I5, R3, measured simultaneously on every run.
**Parts bin:** component catalog (C1-C33+), extended as gaps are identified.

---

## Current Composition

```
raw pixels → avgpool4 → centered encoding (C4, 256 dims)
  → W (shared: encoding projection + action salience)
  → LPL update (Hebbian + predictive, modifies W)
  → adaptive softmax (T = 1/std(salience))
  → action
```

**Stage results (Step 1253, 3 games × 5 draws):**

| Stage | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| R3 | **PASS** (VC33 4/5) | Jacobian diff 0.055-0.066 vs 0.05 threshold. W modifies with experience. |
| I3 | **PASS** (VC33 5/5, LS20 1/5) | Softmax maintains coverage on click games. KB games weaker. |
| I4 | **PARTIAL** (LS20 2/5) | Temporal structure exists but measurement conflated with selection behavior. |
| I1 | **FAIL** (0/15) | Encoding doesn't distinguish analytically-distinct game states. Single-layer W lacks capacity. |
| I5 | **NULL** | No reliable L1 → cross-level transfer unmeasurable. |

**Current bottleneck (revised Step 1274):** Composition works on FT09 only (4/5 L1, PHY advantage over CTL). Three distinct failure classes across 10 games: (1) R3 failure → Physarum dynamics don't engage (tr87, tu93, borderline ls20); (2) Physarum tube reinforcement kills I3 coverage on large click spaces (cd82, cn04); (3) uniform action effects block all exploration signals (sp80). Encoding and I1 are NOT the wall — when L1 is reached (ft09), I1_enc and I1_act both pass (3/5). Next: fix the Physarum-kills-I3 failure mode on click games.

**Remaining gaps:**
1. Bootstrap: viability alpha needs diverse exploration to build spread, needs spread to guide exploration. Proven: encoding CAN distinguish states (ARI=1.000 on VC33 control, Step 1259). The composition can't reach those states.
2. SAL on click games: sparse visits (2.4/action at 10K steps) prevent viability alpha from building spread
3. I3: GPR breaks systematic coverage. Argmin works but ignores encoding.
4. L1: no composition with GPR reaches L1.

**Step 1261 composition (current best):** Argmin warm-up → GPR transition when conc > 0.1. Combined attention (C25 * viability) post-recurrent on ext_enc.
- LS20: R3=0.053, SAL=0.36 (both pass), transition at step 38 (fast)
- VC33: L1 recovered (5/5 at step 2118), transition at step 6220, SAL=-0.16 (insufficient GPR phase)
- SP80: never transitions (conc=0.055 at 10K, uniform action effects)

**Game-type split:** Small action spaces (LS20, 7 actions): viability works, transition fast, R3+SAL pass. Large click spaces (VC33, 4103): L1 recovered via argmin warm-up, but GPR phase too short for SAL. Uniform-response games (SP80): viability can't differentiate actions, stays in argmin permanently.

**Step 1263 (viability-weighted argmin):** SAL=1.00 (15/15, LS20 rho=0.85, VC33 0.49, SP80 0.54). First time SAL passes on ALL games. The encoding perfectly tracks per-action state-change differentiation. L1 unchanged (VC33 5/5 same as control, LS20/SP80 0/5). Gap: encoding knows what each action DOES individually but not what SEQUENCES do collectively. Navigation requires temporal composition.

**Step 1263 FINAL (viability-weighted argmin):** SAL=1.00 all games (LS20 rho=0.85). R3=0.67. L1 unchanged. Encoding perfectly tracks action effects but can't compose sequences.

**Step 1264 (no-selector LPL dynamics):** FAILED. Runaway positive feedback — Hebbian locks onto one action. VC33 regressed 5/5→0/5. SAL=-0.35. LPL creates instability without separate selector.

**Step 1265 (Physarum no-selector):** I4=0.73 (temporal structure passes). But argmax kills coverage — VC33 regressed 5/5→0/5. Same failure as LPL no-selector.

**Step 1266 (Physarum + argmin):** LS20 L1=1/5 (FIRST L1 from encoding-informed composition, outperforms pure argmin 0/5). VC33 L1=5/5 (coverage recovered). SAL=0.829 on LS20. I4=7% on LS20 (passes). Tube-weighted argmin: Physarum dynamics for encoding, argmin for coverage, tube thickness modulates visit priority.

**Step 1267 (anomaly flow + frozen-mean control):** COMPLETE (45 runs, 3 conditions). Mean drift is negligible: live SAL=0.800 vs frozen SAL=0.764 (nearly identical). Frozen I4=9.5% vs live I4=4.8% — slight improvement. Anomaly flow signal is real, not an artifact. VC33 5/5 L1 both conditions. LS20 L1=0/5 both (regression from 1266 raw-flow 1/5, different seeds).

**DIRECTION CHANGE (2026-03-27):** Stop testing at L1. L1 selects for coverage, not understanding. Higher levels require game understanding. Test: substrate observes solver playing all levels on seed A, then acts on seed B. Did the observation transfer?

**Step 1268 (per-level L_max instrumentation, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs). L_max=0 on ALL 30 draws — substrate never escapes L0 within 10K steps. Confirms direction change: solver handoff mandatory. FT09 physarum reached L1 (4/5 draws, ~7K steps), never L2. R3 passes on SP80/FT09 (0.083), dead on TR87 (0.003). SAL near-zero (rho<0.1 everywhere). I4=0 everywhere. lmax_i4 metric unmeasurable without solver transport. Awaiting Leo spec-gate resolution (missing control baseline + wiring spec) before building solver handoff infrastructure.

**Step 1272 (IncSFA for I1, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs, 785.6s). I1=null EVERYWHERE — structural measurement issue: repr_log collects only steps 0-1000, but FT09 L1 reached at ~6000-9000 steps → all repr entries are L0, no between-level pairs for I1. IncSFA does NOT improve L1 vs nSFA: SFA FT09 3/5 vs nSFA 4/5 (nSFA slightly better, within noise). FT09 nSFA draw4 reached Lmax=2 (FIRST L2 for Physarum+argmin composition). R3 stable: SP80/FT09 ~0.083-0.085 both conditions (pass), TR87 0.0035 both (fail). I3: FT09 ρ=0.96 both (pass). SP80 ρ=-0.46 (fail). TR87 varies. Conclusion: I1 is unmeasurable with current repr_log design, not because encoding fails. Measurement fix required before I1 can gate future specs.

**Step 1269 (solver handoff, SP80):** COMPLETE (10 runs). All 10 draws Lmax=FAIL(r=0.0). Solver transports substrate to L5 but substrate can't act within L5 — game timeout at step 120. Confirmed: solver handoff insufficient, substrate needs game-understanding not just placement.

**Step 1270 (observe-then-act, SP80):** CANCELLED after 1 partial draw. Observed all 6 levels on seed A (max_level_observed=6), R3=0.083 passes, but no L1 solve on act phase (seed B). Direction cancelled by Leo mail 3508.

**Step 1271 (ARC score vs solver baseline, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs). ARC=0.0 everywhere — efficiency gap ~1900x on FT09 (substrate L1 at ~7500 steps, solver at 4 steps). FT09 PHY: L1=4/5 vs CtrlC 0/5 (composition provides real L1 benefit). SP80/TR87: Lmax=0 all draws. R3 passes PHY on SP80/FT09 (5/5), fails TR87 (0/5). I3: FT09 both conditions 5/5, TR87 CtrlC 5/5 / PHY 0/5, SP80 0/5 (large action space). ARC score metric correct but provides no gradient at current performance — substrate is 1000-2000x less efficient than solver.

## Solved (locked findings)

1. **R3 solved by composition** (Step 1251). 7 cross-family components composed. Jacobian change 100/100 across 10 games, both wirings. Component-level, not wiring-dependent.

2. **Allosteric principle confirmed** (Steps 1252-1253). Shared W for encoding and action selection. When W changes, both change. No separate bridge needed. First I4 signal (1252). R3+I3 coexist (1253, VC33).

3. **Hierarchy inverted** (Step 1251). R3 passes first, not last. The assumed order I3→I1→I4→I5→R3 is wrong. R3 and I3 are already solved. I1 is the current wall. I4 partially solved. I5 blocked by I1.

4. **Argmin dead in R3 compositions** (Step 1251). I3 identical for composed substrate and argmin-alone. Argmin ignores modified representation. Replaced by allosteric softmax.

5. **Simplicity load-bearing** (PB30, n=6+). Adding complexity degrades. The allosteric substrate has 3 frozen parameters (k, eta_h, eta_p). Fewer than any previous substrate.

## Negative Map (what doesn't work as R3→action bridge)

From 200+ debate experiments: alpha attention, forward models, directional attention, state-conditioned rankings, MI+attention, pixel scanning, EMA recency, empowerment, anti-correlated pairs, softmax concentration. All tested, all failed. The allosteric principle (shared W) is the one architecture that isn't on this list.

## Phase History (fuel, not structure)

- **Phase 1 (Steps 1-416):** 416 experiments. process() = LVQ (1988). Constraint map extracted. R1-R6 formalized.
- **Phase 2 (Steps 417-1081):** 665 experiments. 16 families, 8 killed. 800b/916 as reference substrates. Graph ban, codebook ban (both lifted). Constraint map expanded. R3 remained at 0.
- **Debate v3 (Steps 1082-1250):** ~170 experiments. ℓ₁ vs ℓ_π. Both ≈ random at L1. Draw variance dominates. 200+ killed bridge mechanisms. PB26 (parity), PB30 (simplicity), PB31 (encoding resolution) confirmed.
- **Composition era (Steps 1251+):** Components composed. R3 solved. Allosteric principle. Stage instrumentation. Composition loop begins.

## Next Step

**Step 1273 (repr_log fix + dual I1, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs, 439.4s). **I1 is NOT the wall.** FT09 PHY: I1_enc=3/5 pass (within=0.855, between=1.113) AND I1_act=3/5 pass — both encoding and policy distinguish states when L1 is reached. I1 passes on the same draws, same rate: no bridge problem. SP80/TR87: I1=null (Lmax=0, only 1 level). ControlC FT09: Lmax=0, I1=null. R3: PHY passes SP80/FT09 (5/5), fails TR87 (0.045 < 0.05). I3: FT09 ρ=0.96 both conditions. TR87 CTL ρ=0.75 (pass), PHY ρ=-0.46 to -0.57 (fail). **Wall = what prevents SP80/TR87 from reaching L1.** SP80: uniform response, viability flat. TR87: R3 fails, no self-modification.

**Paradigm shift:** I1 was called "the wall" from Step 1253 to 1272 (20 steps). It was a broken measurement. The encoding DOES distinguish states (I1_enc passes 3/5 on FT09). The allosteric principle works (I1_enc and I1_act pass together). The real wall is L1 reachability on games where the composition can't build Physarum structure.

**Step 1274 (full 10-game PRISM chain):** COMPLETE (100 runs, 26.3 min). Chain ARC=0.0000010. Full failure mode map:

| Game | PHY L1 | CTL L1 | PHY R3 | PHY I3 | CTL I3 | PHY I1enc | Failure mode |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| ft09 | 4/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 | WORKING — PHY provides real L1 advantage |
| vc33 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | Easy L1 — CTL argmin also solves |
| lp85 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | null | null | 5/5 | Easy L1 — both conditions, identical l1_step=1870 (game seed-independent) |
| ls20 | 1/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | null | R3 borderline fail (0.044 vs 0.05 threshold), PHY I3 negative — Physarum hurts LS20 coverage |
| sb26 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | null | R3+I3 pass but L1=0 — requires specific click sequence, neither argmin nor Physarum discovers it |
| sp80 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | null | Uniform response — I3 fails both conditions |
| cd82 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | null | PHY I3 fails — Physarum tube reinforcement kills coverage on large click space |
| cn04 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | null | PHY I3 fails — same as cd82 |
| tr87 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | null | R3 fails — no self-modification (Jacobian diff ≈0.04 < 0.05 threshold) |
| tu93 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | null | R3 fails — same as tr87 |

**Failure mode clusters:**
1. **R3 failure** (tr87, tu93, borderline ls20): W doesn't modify meaningfully. Physarum dynamics don't engage. Jacobian diff 0.04 vs threshold 0.05.
2. **I3 failure — Physarum kills coverage** (cd82, cn04): PHY I3 NEGATIVE where CTL I3 passes. Tube dynamics create action loops that hurt exploration on large click spaces.
3. **Uniform response** (sp80): Both conditions I3 fail. Action effects indistinguishable → no coverage signal.
4. **Sequence-locked** (sb26): All stages pass (R3+I3) but game requires specific click sequence not discoverable by exploration.
5. **Easy L1** (vc33, lp85): Physarum composition provides no unique advantage — argmin alone sufficient.
6. **PHY advantage** (ft09 only): R3+I3+I1 all pass, PHY L1=4/5 vs CTL=0/5. Composition provides real benefit on exactly ONE game.

**Key finding:** Composition works on FT09 only. The wall is not I1 (encoding works when L1 is reached), but stage prerequisites (R3 failing → no Physarum dynamics; I3 failing → Physarum reinforcement hurts coverage). LP85/VC33 L1 is free — CTL argmin also solves.

**Step 1275 (novelty-gated tube flow):** KILL. Novelty gate zero effect on I3. Root cause: Physarum conflates "changes encoding" with "should explore." Responsive actions produce the most novel deltas, so novelty gating still reinforces them. Physarum dynamics component KILLED after 5 consecutive failures (1271-1275).

**Step 1276 (LPL prediction error replaces Physarum):** KILL *(retroactively PASS under I3_cv — see Step 1280)*. 100 runs, 8.1 min.

| Game | LPE L1 | CTL L1 | LPE I3 | CTL I3 | LPE R3 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| ft09 | 4/5 | 0/5 | 0.96 (5/5) | 0.96 (5/5) | 0.947 (5/5) |
| ls20 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0.31 (2/5) | 0.64 (5/5) | 0.047 (0/5) |
| vc33 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 0.96 (5/5) | 0.96 (5/5) | 0.924 (5/5) |
| tr87 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0.42 (3/5) | 0.75 (5/5) | 0.046 (0/5) |
| sp80 | 0/5 | 0/5 | -0.46 (0/5) | -0.46 (0/5) | 0.909 (5/5) |
| sb26 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0.89 (5/5) | 0.89 (5/5) | 0.915 (5/5) |
| tu93 | 0/5 | 0/5 | -0.00 (0/5) | 0.86 (5/5) | 0.046 (0/5) |
| cn04 | 0/5 | 0/5 | -0.68 (0/5) | -0.68 (0/5) | 0.925 (5/5) |
| cd82 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0.39 (0/5) | 0.39 (0/5) | 0.944 (5/5) |
| lp85 | 5/5 | 5/5 | null | null | 0.944 (5/5) |

Root cause: W_pred (256×256 linear) cannot discriminate loop vs game-advancing actions. Loop actions at different game states produce different encoding deltas → W_pred can't learn stable predictions → pe stays high for loop actions. PE diagnostic confirms no differentiation: LS20 top7 pe@5000 all similar (0.30-0.43), TR87 top7 all similar (0.085-0.103). New regression on TU93 (I3 -0.00 vs CTL 0.86). I3 regressed further on LS20/TR87 (worse than Physarum). FT09 L1 maintained (pe≈0 on click games, mechanism neutral). KILL: per-action prediction error signal is too noisy to differentiate action types in high-dimensional encoding space.

**Critical realization from 1276 PE diagnostic:** FT09 pe≈0 for all actions (mean 0.001). LPE ≈ pure argmin on FT09. Yet FT09 L1=4/5 vs CTL 0/5. The ONLY difference is LPL encoding modification (R3). The FT09 advantage was never from dynamics (Physarum or LPE). It's from R3. 12 steps investigating dynamics (1264-1276) when the encoding was doing all the work.

**Step 1277 (strip dynamics, bare LPL+argmin):** COMPLETE (100 runs, 7.9 min). Hypothesis overturned — and more precise.

FT09 L1=0/5 (same as CTL). R3 encoding alone does NOT explain FT09 advantage. Pe signal was contributing even at mean 0.001 — tiny absolute values create selective bias across 4103 actions when most have visit_count=0-2.

I3 FULLY RECOVERED: LS20=0.64(5/5), TR87=0.75(5/5), TU93=0.86(5/5) — all match CTL exactly. Pe dynamics WERE the regression source. Strip them → CTL I3 behavior restored.

**Key finding — pe scale sensitivity:** Pe signal has opposite effects by action space size:
- Large (FT09, 4103 actions): pe_ema mean=0.001, max=0.055. Tiny pe sufficient to differentiate game-advancing from loop clicks at scale. HELPS.
- Small (LS20, 7 actions): pe_ema mean=0.35. Pe values dominate argmin, kill coverage. HURTS.
- SELECTION_ALPHA=0.1 appropriate for FT09 but 100x too strong for LS20.

**Gap: pe normalization.** score = action_counts - alpha * (pe_ema / (max(pe_ema) + eps)) would bound signal to [0,1] regardless of action space. Preserves relative ordering on all games.

**Step 1278 (normalized pe):** KILL. 100 runs, 519.8s.

| Game  | NPE I3        | CTL I3        | NPE L1 | CTL L1 |
|-------|---------------|---------------|--------|--------|

| sp80  | -0.464 (0/5)  | -0.464 (0/5)  | 0/5    | 0/5    |

FT09 L1 restored (3/5 vs CTL 0/5). Kill criterion triggered by I3 regressions on LS20 (2/5 vs CTL 5/5), TR87 (3/5 vs CTL 5/5), TU93 (0/5 vs CTL 5/5).

Root cause: normalization bounds pe to [0,1] but does NOT make pe invisible on KB games. EMA ramps up from first visit (~14 visits/action by step 100 on 7-action games). At step 100: LS20 pe_ema mean=0.276 (max/mean=1.06x), TR87 mean=0.042 (max/mean=1.38x), TU93 mean=0.124 (max/mean=1.36x). After normalization, top7 pe_norm values differ by ~0.15 → score difference ~0.015 against visit_count ~14. Early EMA bootstrap creates order-dependent bias before I3 measurement at step 200. FT09 pe@100 mean=0.000005 (4103 actions, only 7 visited) — normalization is essentially inactive on click games.

**Consolidated finding — pe signal on KB games:** Any pe-based action selection has early-step bootstrap problems on small action spaces (7 actions). Pe EMA ramps up faster than I3 can measure coverage (I3 measured at step 200, pe active from step 1). Scale-based fix (normalization) does not help because the signal is already structured by step 100. Temporal-based fix needed (delayed activation past step 200) OR a different signal that is zero at uniform visitation.

**Step 1279 (pe tiebreaker):** KILL. 100 runs, 519.5s.

| Game  | PTB I3        | CTL I3        | PTB L1 | CTL L1 |
|-------|---------------|---------------|--------|--------|

Kill criterion: I3 regressions on LS20/TR87/TU93. FT09 L1=3/5 (maintained).

**I3 ARTIFACT CONFIRMED — LS20 I3 is broken metric (Step 1279 permutation diagnostic):**

CTL I3=0.64 on LS20 is entirely deterministic:
- CTL counts at step 200: [29,29,29,29,28,28,28] — IDENTICAL across all 5 draws/seeds
- LS20 kb_delta = [376,16,232,232,0,0,0] — actions 0-3 are responsive, 4-6 = 0
- Argmin always visits actions 0-3 first (200/7=28r4 → first 4 get extra visit)
- LS20's responsive actions happen to be indices 0-3 → Spearman=0.64 is fully determined by index ordering, not coverage quality

**Permutation test (10 runs, LS20):**
- CTL (index order): I3=0.643 (5/5 pass) — all seeds identical
- CTL (random permutation): I3=-0.279 (1/5 pass) — ranges from -0.857 to +0.64 depending on permutation

**Implication:** I3 "regressions" on LS20 in Steps 1274-1278 were measuring whether pe dynamics changed which action wins the argmin tie at step 200 — NOT whether coverage quality degraded. TR87 and TU93 are likely also artifact games (small action spaces, deterministic tie order correlating with kb_delta). All pe-based "LS20 I3 kills" may be false alarms from a broken metric.

I3 criterion on KB games needs replacement. SAL (action salience vs kb_responsiveness) is the better coverage proxy for small-action-space games. Pending Leo decision on retroactive reanalysis of 1275-1278.

**Step 1280 (fix I3 metric + re-run 1276):** COMPOSITION CONFIRMED. 115 runs (100 main + 15 I3_perm), 8.1 min.

**I3_cv (corrected metric): LPE == CTL on ALL 10 games. Zero regressions.**

I3_cv pass criterion: LPE_cv ≤ CTL_cv × 1.1. Pass ratio = 1.000 on all games (identical distributions).

**I3_perm artifact universal across all KB games:**
- LS20: CTL=0.643 → CTLp=-0.279
- TR87: CTL=0.750 → CTLp=-0.200
- TU93: CTL=0.857 → CTLp=-0.193

**Retroactive verdict (Steps 1274-1278):** All I3 regressions on KB games were false alarms from broken I3_rho metric. Coverage quality (I3_cv) was never degraded in those steps.

**pe_snapshot insight:** pe_ema bootstraps very differently by action space:
- FT09 (4103 actions): pe_ema mean=5e-6 at step 100 — essentially zero
- LS20 (7 actions): pe_ema mean=0.277 at step 100 — already active
Small-action-space pe bootstraps fast because each action is visited ~14x by step 100. This is why additive pe can influence LS20 I3_rho (changes tie-breaking order) but not FT09 I3_rho (pe too small to override counts).

**Conclusion:** Step 1276 (LPL PE, alpha=0.1, unnormalized) IS the current composition.
- FT09 L1=4/5 vs CTL 0/5 (real advantage, unchanged across 1276/1278/1279/1280)
- No I3_cv regressions on any game
- R3 borderline on 7-action games (0.046-0.049 vs 0.05 threshold) — marginal fail on LS20/TR87/TU93
- Next: Step 1281 (pe_delta = compression progress, replaces pe_ema as signal)

**Step 1281 (pe_delta compression progress):** KILL. 100 runs, 527s.

pe_delta = pe_ema_prev - pe_ema. Actions where pe is dropping fastest get priority.

| Game | LPED_cv | CTL_cv | LPED_L1 | CTL_L1 | LPED_R3 |

| (others unchanged vs CTL)  |

Kill criterion: FT09 L1 regressed 4/5 → 3/5 vs 1276 (pe_ema). No improvement on any game.

Root cause: pe_delta bootstrap harder than pe_ema. On FT09 (4103 actions, ~0.05 visits/action at step 200), most actions have pe_ema_prev = pe_ema = 0 → pe_delta = 0. Signal only activates on actions visited ≥2x. For LS20 (7 actions), pe_delta more aggressive than pe_ema (I3_rho -0.586 vs -0.307) — deeper artifact, same CV.

**1276 (pe_ema, alpha=0.1, unnormalized) confirmed as composition. FT09 L1=4/5 is the benchmark.**

**Step 1282 (eta_h=0.05 vs 0.01):** CONDITIONAL PASS. 100 runs, 780s.

I3_cv: E05 == E01 on all games. No regressions. FT09 kill criterion not triggered (4/5 ≥ 3/5).

TR87 anomaly: 6 actions, R3 essentially unchanged (0.0455→0.0460). flow signal (||enc_t+1 - enc_t||) likely near-zero on TR87 — obs doesn't change visually → W_action doesn't accumulate regardless of eta_h.

LS20/TU93 L1 still 0/5 despite R3 now passing — R3 is necessary but not sufficient. eta_h=0.05 adopted as new composition baseline (Leo mail 3579).

**Step 1283 (temporal PE: W_pred 256×320 on [enc;h] vs W_pred 256×256 on enc):** KILL. 100 runs, 879s.

| Game | TPE R3 | LPE R3 | TPE L1 | LPE L1 |

I4: Both conditions identical (-79.55% click, -0.03% KB). Temporal PE provides zero I4 benefit.

Kill: FT09 L1 3/5 (TPE) vs 5/5 (LPE). W_pred on [enc;h] adds noise to PE signal on FT09 — click games are order-free (SET not sequence), so h_t context is irrelevant and degrades PE discrimination. No LS20 improvement. Kill criterion: FT09 L1 regression + no I4 gain.

**Full L1 prescription analysis (Step 1283, post-mortem):**

| Game | L1 actions | Unique | Type | Structure | PE reachable? |
|------|-----------|--------|------|-----------|---------------|
| FT09 | 2 | 2 | clicks | SET (2 pixels) | YES (1-2/5) |
| VC33 | 1 | 1 | click | SET (1 pixel) | YES (5/5) |
| LP85 | 3 | 1 | click | SET (1 pixel x3) | YES (5/5) |
| SB26 | 7 | 7 | clicks | SET/SEQ? (7 pixels) | MAYBE |
| SP80 | 2 | 1 | KB | SEQ (key x2) | NO |
| CD82 | 24 | 19 | mixed | SEQ (KB+clicks) | NO |

| LS20 | 13 | ? | KB | SEQ | NO |
| TR87 | ? | ? | KB | SEQ | NO |
| TU93 | ? | ? | KB | SEQ | NO |

**PE+argmin ceiling:** 3/10 games (FT09/VC33/LP85). PE works when L1 = 1-2 unique high-index click positions. Fails when L1 needs ordered sequences or ≥7 unique clicks. Remaining 7 games require temporal credit assignment (prospective, not retrospective PE).

**Step 1284 (KB injection diagnostic: forced KB action every 50 steps):** DIAGNOSTIC — wall confirmed as sequences, not coverage. 100 runs, ~14 min.

KB injection confirmed working: 200 forced KB actions per seed (steps % 50 == 0), ~28-33 visits per KB index 0-6.

FT09 slight regression (4/5 KBI vs 5/5 LPE): I3rho drops 0.96→~0.26 mean from forced KB injections polluting PE correlation on click-heavy games. I3cv unchanged. L1 maintained on VC33/LP85 despite I3rho drop (their prescriptions are simpler).

**Conclusion:** KB coverage alone is insufficient. ~29 visits per KB index, zero new games unlocked. SP80 and SB26 unchanged (Leo's predicted improvements did not materialize). Wall = sequential credit assignment: substrate visited KB actions but cannot detect which SEQUENCES advance the game. Next component class: temporal abstractions / macro-actions / successor representations for sequence discovery without reward signal.

**Step 1285 (N-step displacement, N=10, replaces pe_ema):** KILL. 100 runs, 687s.

Kill: FT09 L1 = 0/5 (regression from 5/5 LPE). No L1 improvement on any failing game.

Root cause: FT09 needs systematic argmin coverage of 4103 actions to find 2 target clicks. LPE works because pe_ema≈0 on FT09 → pure argmin. Displacement introduces spurious biases — early high-displacement windows boost wrong actions, breaking systematic coverage. argmin revisits boosted actions instead of continuing exploration.

I4 finding: displacement at N=10 produces no temporal structure. I4 = -79.5% on ALL click games in BOTH conditions (entropy increases over time as argmin covers more unique positions). I4 = -0.0% on KB games (flat distribution). Zero difference between D10 and LPE on I4.

Open questions: Is the wall the window size (need N≫10 for full sequence capture)? Or the attribution method (all window actions get equal displacement credit → dilutes signal)?

**SP80 count-dominance diagnostic (Eli mail 3604):** At step 5000, KB-3 pe_ema=0.29 (signal found, bonus=0.029) but argmin score=28.97 vs 0 for unvisited click. Discovery is permanent but unexploitable. Argmin-of-counts is structurally incompatible with KB sequence discovery — no selection signal fixes this within argmin.

**Literature connection — eigenoptions (Eli mail 3605):** W_action (4103×256) is already a one-step empirical SR. SVD → top-k right singular vectors = encoding directions most coupled to actions. Eigenoption policy: argmin_a ||h + W_action[a] - h_target|| where h_target = projection onto eigenvector subspace. Produces emergent sequences (goal-conditioned single-action selection). The Sketched Jacobian measured for R3 IS the same Jacobian eigenoptions exploit. Papers: Machado et al. JMLR 2023 (arxiv:2110.05740), ICLR 2024.

**Step 1286b (topological diagnostic, SP80 KBI 3K steps):** NOT SEPARABLE. h-trajectories during KB vs click action windows occupy same encoding region. Cosine within-KB=0.9406, within-click=0.9970, between=0.9849. Separation ratio=1.017 (threshold 1.2). PCA: KB centroid at (-0.015, -0.067), click centroid at (0.000, +0.001). LPL encoding does not represent action-type information in h-space. Caveat: measures pre-action h_t, not post-action h_{t+1}. Implication: eigenoptions (W_action SVD) unlikely to find KB-specific directions on undifferentiated-encoding games.

**Composition loop status (Steps 1271-1287, 17 experiments):**
- Confirmed composition: LPL + pe_ema + argmin, alpha=0.1, eta_h=0.05 (Step 1276/1282)
- Ceiling: 3/10 games at L1 (FT09 5/5, VC33 5/5, LP85 5/5)
- Wall: 7/10 games need sequence discovery. Argmin-of-counts structurally incompatible (count dominance). KB coverage insufficient (1284). N-step displacement insufficient (1285).
- Two broken measurements fixed (I1 repr_log, I3 index artifact)
- **Step 1286 (causal controls: frozen_init/frozen_mid/eta_slow/lpl_pe_ctrl): COMPLETE.** 200 runs (10 games × 4 conditions × 5 draws), 1539s.
  - **R3 is causally weight-driven.** frozen_init collapses R3 to ~0.001-0.05 (vs 0.66-0.94 for all other conditions). Weight updates are the mechanism.
  - **L1 performance is weight-learning-independent.** Games that solve (ft09/lp85/vc33) solve at equal rates across all 4 conditions including frozen_init. Games that fail (7) fail in all 4 conditions regardless.
  - frozen_mid R3 indistinguishable from CTL: 5K steps sufficient to establish full R3 signal.
  - eta_slow (×0.1) preserves R3 and L1 equally. Mechanism not rate-sensitive in this range.
  - I3_cv: identical across all conditions (3.098). Action selection mechanism unchanged.
  - arc_score: 0.000 in all conditions (no L2 reached).
  - Interpretation: R3 (self-modification) is real and weight-driven. But R3 without changed action selection (argmin unchanged) produces no behavioral change. Bottleneck confirmed as action selection, not representation learning.
- **Step 1287 (pairwise transition count argmin): KILL.** Zero new L1 on failing games. R3 regression LS20/TU93 (0.047 vs 0.086). Root cause: pairwise degenerates to pe_ema-argmax on click games (all pairs count=0 when prev=click), KB-KB pairs never accumulate consecutively.
  - I3 CV explosion on click games: FT09 PAR=32.81 vs CTL=4.42. Concentrated selection pattern.
  - FT09/VC33/LP85 maintained (no regression). 7 failing games unchanged.
- **Step 1288 (encoding-change momentum): KILL.** 100 runs (10 games × 2 conditions × 5 draws).
  - **FT09 hard regression:** MOM L1=0/5 vs CTL 0.80. Momentum fires at 34.6% on FT09, breaking systematic argmin coverage needed to find 2 target clicks among 4103.
  - **I3_cv regression +116%:** MOM I3_cv=6.678 vs CTL=3.098. Concentrated visitation — momentum repeats high-enc_change actions (any visually-responsive click), creating skewed distribution.
  - **I4 unchanged or worse:** MOM I4=-62.5% vs CTL=-55.7%. VC33/SP80 much worse (-141.9%/-131.1% vs -79.5%). No temporal structure improvement.
  - **R3 intact:** No R3 regression (0.670 both). R3 kill criterion not triggered.
  - Root cause: adaptive threshold (running median) means momentum fires on ~50% of all steps — far too frequently. High-enc_change actions are visually-interesting clicks, not game-advancing sequences. Temporal structure problem unresolved.
  - Open: fixed/higher-percentile threshold (90th?) would fire less and preserve I3 coverage. Not tested.
