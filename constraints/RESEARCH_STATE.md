## The Search Is a Composition Loop

The search finds substrates by composing validated components, testing against developmental stages, identifying the failing stage, finding or building the component for that stage, and composing again.

**Unit of search:** a composition of components, not an individual substrate.
**Architecture:** allosteric  - encoding and action selection share parameters (W).
**Test framework:** stages I3, I1, I4, I5, R3, measured simultaneously on every run.
**Parts bin:** component catalog (C1-C33+), extended as gaps are identified.

## Current Composition

```
raw pixels → avgpool4 → centered encoding (C4, 256 dims)
  → W (shared: encoding projection + action salience)
  → LPL update (Hebbian + predictive, modifies W)
  → adaptive softmax (T = 1/std(salience))
  → action
```

**Stage results (Step 1253, 3 games × 5 draws):**

| Stage | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| R3 | **PASS** (VC33 4/5) | Jacobian diff 0.055-0.066 vs 0.05 threshold. W modifies with experience. |
| I3 | **PASS** (VC33 5/5, LS20 1/5) | Softmax maintains coverage on click games. KB games weaker. |
| I4 | **PARTIAL** (LS20 2/5) | Temporal structure exists but measurement conflated with selection behavior. |
| I1 | **FAIL** (0/15) | Encoding doesn't distinguish analytically-distinct game states. Single-layer W lacks capacity. |
| I5 | **NULL** | No reliable L1 → cross-level transfer unmeasurable. |

**Current bottleneck (revised Step 1274):** Composition works on FT09 only (4/5 L1, PHY advantage over CTL). Three distinct failure classes across 10 games: (1) R3 failure → Physarum dynamics don't engage (tr87, tu93, borderline ls20); (2) Physarum tube reinforcement kills I3 coverage on large click spaces (cd82, cn04); (3) uniform action effects block all exploration signals (sp80). Encoding and I1 are NOT the wall — when L1 is reached (ft09), I1_enc and I1_act both pass (3/5). Next: fix the Physarum-kills-I3 failure mode on click games.

**Remaining gaps:**
1. Bootstrap: viability alpha needs diverse exploration to build spread, needs spread to guide exploration. Proven: encoding CAN distinguish states (ARI=1.000 on VC33 control, Step 1259). The composition can't reach those states.
2. SAL on click games: sparse visits (2.4/action at 10K steps) prevent viability alpha from building spread
3. I3: GPR breaks systematic coverage. Argmin works but ignores encoding.
4. L1: no composition with GPR reaches L1.

**Step 1261 composition (current best):** Argmin warm-up → GPR transition when conc > 0.1. Combined attention (C25 * viability) post-recurrent on ext_enc.
- LS20: R3=0.053, SAL=0.36 (both pass), transition at step 38 (fast)
- VC33: L1 recovered (5/5 at step 2118), transition at step 6220, SAL=-0.16 (insufficient GPR phase)
- SP80: never transitions (conc=0.055 at 10K, uniform action effects)

**Game-type split:** Small action spaces (LS20, 7 actions): viability works, transition fast, R3+SAL pass. Large click spaces (VC33, 4103): L1 recovered via argmin warm-up, but GPR phase too short for SAL. Uniform-response games (SP80): viability can't differentiate actions, stays in argmin permanently.

**Step 1263 (viability-weighted argmin):** SAL=1.00 (15/15, LS20 rho=0.85, VC33 0.49, SP80 0.54). First time SAL passes on ALL games. The encoding perfectly tracks per-action state-change differentiation. L1 unchanged (VC33 5/5 same as control, LS20/SP80 0/5). Gap: encoding knows what each action DOES individually but not what SEQUENCES do collectively. Navigation requires temporal composition.

**Step 1263 FINAL (viability-weighted argmin):** SAL=1.00 all games (LS20 rho=0.85). R3=0.67. L1 unchanged. Encoding perfectly tracks action effects but can't compose sequences.

**Step 1264 (no-selector LPL dynamics):** FAILED. Runaway positive feedback — Hebbian locks onto one action. VC33 regressed 5/5→0/5. SAL=-0.35. LPL creates instability without separate selector.

**Step 1265 (Physarum no-selector):** I4=0.73 (temporal structure passes). But argmax kills coverage — VC33 regressed 5/5→0/5. Same failure as LPL no-selector.

**Step 1266 (Physarum + argmin):** LS20 L1=1/5 (FIRST L1 from encoding-informed composition, outperforms pure argmin 0/5). VC33 L1=5/5 (coverage recovered). SAL=0.829 on LS20. I4=7% on LS20 (passes). Tube-weighted argmin: Physarum dynamics for encoding, argmin for coverage, tube thickness modulates visit priority.

**Step 1267 (anomaly flow + frozen-mean control):** COMPLETE (45 runs, 3 conditions). Mean drift is negligible: live SAL=0.800 vs frozen SAL=0.764 (nearly identical). Frozen I4=9.5% vs live I4=4.8% — slight improvement. Anomaly flow signal is real, not an artifact. VC33 5/5 L1 both conditions. LS20 L1=0/5 both (regression from 1266 raw-flow 1/5, different seeds).

**DIRECTION CHANGE (2026-03-27):** Stop testing at L1. L1 selects for coverage, not understanding. Higher levels require game understanding. Test: substrate observes solver playing all levels on seed A, then acts on seed B. Did the observation transfer?

**Step 1268 (per-level L_max instrumentation, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs). L_max=0 on ALL 30 draws — substrate never escapes L0 within 10K steps. Confirms direction change: solver handoff mandatory. FT09 physarum reached L1 (4/5 draws, ~7K steps), never L2. R3 passes on SP80/FT09 (0.083), dead on TR87 (0.003). SAL near-zero (rho<0.1 everywhere). I4=0 everywhere. lmax_i4 metric unmeasurable without solver transport. Awaiting Leo spec-gate resolution (missing control baseline + wiring spec) before building solver handoff infrastructure.

**Step 1272 (IncSFA for I1, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs, 785.6s). I1=null EVERYWHERE — structural measurement issue: repr_log collects only steps 0-1000, but FT09 L1 reached at ~6000-9000 steps → all repr entries are L0, no between-level pairs for I1. IncSFA does NOT improve L1 vs nSFA: SFA FT09 3/5 vs nSFA 4/5 (nSFA slightly better, within noise). FT09 nSFA draw4 reached Lmax=2 (FIRST L2 for Physarum+argmin composition). R3 stable: SP80/FT09 ~0.083-0.085 both conditions (pass), TR87 0.0035 both (fail). I3: FT09 ρ=0.96 both (pass). SP80 ρ=-0.46 (fail). TR87 varies. Conclusion: I1 is unmeasurable with current repr_log design, not because encoding fails. Measurement fix required before I1 can gate future specs.

**Step 1269 (solver handoff, SP80):** COMPLETE (10 runs). All 10 draws Lmax=FAIL(r=0.0). Solver transports substrate to L5 but substrate can't act within L5 — game timeout at step 120. Confirmed: solver handoff insufficient, substrate needs game-understanding not just placement.

**Step 1270 (observe-then-act, SP80):** CANCELLED after 1 partial draw. Observed all 6 levels on seed A (max_level_observed=6), R3=0.083 passes, but no L1 solve on act phase (seed B). Direction cancelled by Leo mail 3508.

**Step 1271 (ARC score vs solver baseline, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs). ARC=0.0 everywhere — efficiency gap ~1900x on FT09 (substrate L1 at ~7500 steps, solver at 4 steps). FT09 PHY: L1=4/5 vs CtrlC 0/5 (composition provides real L1 benefit). SP80/TR87: Lmax=0 all draws. R3 passes PHY on SP80/FT09 (5/5), fails TR87 (0/5). I3: FT09 both conditions 5/5, TR87 CtrlC 5/5 / PHY 0/5, SP80 0/5 (large action space). ARC score metric correct but provides no gradient at current performance — substrate is 1000-2000x less efficient than solver.

## Solved (locked findings)

1. **R3 solved by composition** (Step 1251). 7 cross-family components composed. Jacobian change 100/100 across 10 games, both wirings. Component-level, not wiring-dependent.

2. **Allosteric principle confirmed** (Steps 1252-1253). Shared W for encoding and action selection. When W changes, both change. No separate bridge needed. First I4 signal (1252). R3+I3 coexist (1253, VC33).

3. **Hierarchy inverted** (Step 1251). R3 passes first, not last. The assumed order I3→I1→I4→I5→R3 is wrong. R3 and I3 are already solved. I1 is the current wall. I4 partially solved. I5 blocked by I1.

4. **Argmin dead in R3 compositions** (Step 1251). I3 identical for composed substrate and argmin-alone. Argmin ignores modified representation. Replaced by allosteric softmax.

5. **Simplicity load-bearing** (PB30, n=6+). Adding complexity degrades. The allosteric substrate has 3 frozen parameters (k, eta_h, eta_p). Fewer than any previous substrate.

## Negative Map (what doesn't work as R3→action bridge)

From 200+ debate experiments: alpha attention, forward models, directional attention, state-conditioned rankings, MI+attention, pixel scanning, EMA recency, empowerment, anti-correlated pairs, softmax concentration. All tested, all failed. The allosteric principle (shared W) is the one architecture that isn't on this list.

## Phase History (fuel, not structure)

- **Phase 1 (Steps 1-416):** 416 experiments. process() = LVQ (1988). Constraint map extracted. R1-R6 formalized.
- **Phase 2 (Steps 417-1081):** 665 experiments. 16 families, 8 killed. 800b/916 as reference substrates. Graph ban, codebook ban (both lifted). Constraint map expanded. R3 remained at 0.
- **Debate v3 (Steps 1082-1250):** ~170 experiments. ℓ₁ vs ℓ_π. Both ≈ random at L1. Draw variance dominates. 200+ killed bridge mechanisms. PB26 (parity), PB30 (simplicity), PB31 (encoding resolution) confirmed.
- **Composition era (Steps 1251+):** Components composed. R3 solved. Allosteric principle. Stage instrumentation. Composition loop begins.

## Next Step

**Step 1273 (repr_log fix + dual I1, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs, 439.4s). **I1 is NOT the wall.** FT09 PHY: I1_enc=3/5 pass (within=0.855, between=1.113) AND I1_act=3/5 pass — both encoding and policy distinguish states when L1 is reached. I1 passes on the same draws, same rate: no bridge problem. SP80/TR87: I1=null (Lmax=0, only 1 level). ControlC FT09: Lmax=0, I1=null. R3: PHY passes SP80/FT09 (5/5), fails TR87 (0.045 < 0.05). I3: FT09 ρ=0.96 both conditions. TR87 CTL ρ=0.75 (pass), PHY ρ=-0.46 to -0.57 (fail). **Wall = what prevents SP80/TR87 from reaching L1.** SP80: uniform response, viability flat. TR87: R3 fails, no self-modification.

**Paradigm shift:** I1 was called "the wall" from Step 1253 to 1272 (20 steps). It was a broken measurement. The encoding DOES distinguish states (I1_enc passes 3/5 on FT09). The allosteric principle works (I1_enc and I1_act pass together). The real wall is L1 reachability on games where the composition can't build Physarum structure.

**Step 1274 (full 10-game PRISM chain):** COMPLETE (100 runs, 26.3 min). Chain ARC=0.0000010. Full failure mode map:

| Game | PHY L1 | CTL L1 | PHY R3 | PHY I3 | CTL I3 | PHY I1enc | Failure mode |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| ft09 | 4/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 | WORKING — PHY provides real L1 advantage |
| vc33 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | Easy L1 — CTL argmin also solves |
| lp85 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | null | null | 5/5 | Easy L1 — both conditions, identical l1_step=1870 (game seed-independent) |
| ls20 | 1/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | null | R3 borderline fail (0.044 vs 0.05 threshold), PHY I3 negative — Physarum hurts LS20 coverage |
| sb26 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | null | R3+I3 pass but L1=0 — requires specific click sequence, neither argmin nor Physarum discovers it |
| sp80 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | null | Uniform response — I3 fails both conditions |
| cd82 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | null | PHY I3 fails — Physarum tube reinforcement kills coverage on large click space |
| cn04 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | null | PHY I3 fails — same as cd82 |
| tr87 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | null | R3 fails — no self-modification (Jacobian diff ≈0.04 < 0.05 threshold) |
| tu93 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | null | R3 fails — same as tr87 |

**Failure mode clusters:**
1. **R3 failure** (tr87, tu93, borderline ls20): W doesn't modify meaningfully. Physarum dynamics don't engage. Jacobian diff 0.04 vs threshold 0.05.
2. **I3 failure — Physarum kills coverage** (cd82, cn04): PHY I3 NEGATIVE where CTL I3 passes. Tube dynamics create action loops that hurt exploration on large click spaces.
3. **Uniform response** (sp80): Both conditions I3 fail. Action effects indistinguishable → no coverage signal.
4. **Sequence-locked** (sb26): All stages pass (R3+I3) but game requires specific click sequence not discoverable by exploration.
5. **Easy L1** (vc33, lp85): Physarum composition provides no unique advantage — argmin alone sufficient.
6. **PHY advantage** (ft09 only): R3+I3+I1 all pass, PHY L1=4/5 vs CTL=0/5. Composition provides real benefit on exactly ONE game.

**Key finding:** Composition works on FT09 only. The wall is not I1 (encoding works when L1 is reached), but stage prerequisites (R3 failing → no Physarum dynamics; I3 failing → Physarum reinforcement hurts coverage). LP85/VC33 L1 is free — CTL argmin also solves.

**Step 1275 (novelty-gated tube flow):** KILL. Novelty gate zero effect on I3. Root cause: Physarum conflates "changes encoding" with "should explore." Responsive actions produce the most novel deltas, so novelty gating still reinforces them. Physarum dynamics component KILLED after 5 consecutive failures (1271-1275).

**Step 1276 (LPL prediction error replaces Physarum):** Dynamics component swap. Replace Physarum tube flow with per-action LPL prediction error as argmin weight. Loop actions become predicted (pe drops → suppressed). Novel-destination actions stay unpredicted (pe stays high → prioritized). Decouples "large encoding change" from "should explore." Full 10-game PRISM chain.
