## The Search Is a Composition Loop

The search finds substrates by composing validated components, testing against developmental stages, identifying the failing stage, finding or building the component for that stage, and composing again.

**Unit of search:** a composition of components, not an individual substrate.
**Architecture:** reflexive map  - W both encodes observations and selects actions through the same computation (R2). Any separate selector is frozen frame.
**Test framework:** stages I3, I1, I4, I5, R3, measured simultaneously on every run.
**Parts bin:** component catalog (C1-C33+), extended as gaps are identified.

## Current Composition (Reflexive Map)

*"Reflexive map" = W both encodes and selects through the same computation. R2 requires this. Any separate selector is frozen frame.*

```
raw pixels → avgpool4 → centered encoding (C4, 256 dims)
  → W (reflexive map: encoding + action selection, same computation)
  → update dynamics: OPEN — LPL Hebbian trains W for visual responsiveness, not level advancement
  → action selection through W: OPEN — 3 selectors tested (softmax/refractory/dead), all fail identically
```

**Status (2026-03-28):** Reflexive map validated for encoding (R3=100/100). W-driven action selection fails due to training signal (Steps 1289-1291: 3 selectors, same failure → W_action problem, not selector problem). Next: fix W's update dynamics (competitive inhibition, winnerless competition, anti-Hebbian).

**Stage results (Step 1253, 3 games × 5 draws):**

| Stage | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| R3 | **PASS** (VC33 4/5) | Jacobian diff 0.055-0.066 vs 0.05 threshold. W modifies with experience. |
| I3 | **PASS** (VC33 5/5, LS20 1/5) | Softmax maintains coverage on click games. KB games weaker. |
| I4 | **PARTIAL** (LS20 2/5) | Temporal structure exists but measurement conflated with selection behavior. |
| I1 | **FAIL** (0/15) | Encoding doesn't distinguish analytically-distinct game states. Single-layer W lacks capacity. |
| I5 | **NULL** | No reliable L1 → cross-level transfer unmeasurable. |

**Current bottleneck (revised Step 1274):** Composition works on FT09 only (4/5 L1, PHY advantage over CTL). Three distinct failure classes across 10 games: (1) R3 failure → Physarum dynamics don't engage (tr87, tu93, borderline ls20); (2) Physarum tube reinforcement kills I3 coverage on large click spaces (cd82, cn04); (3) uniform action effects block all exploration signals (sp80). Encoding and I1 are NOT the wall — when L1 is reached (ft09), I1_enc and I1_act both pass (3/5). Next: fix the Physarum-kills-I3 failure mode on click games.

**Remaining gaps:**
1. Bootstrap: viability alpha needs diverse exploration to build spread, needs spread to guide exploration. Proven: encoding CAN distinguish states (ARI=1.000 on VC33 control, Step 1259). The composition can't reach those states.
2. SAL on click games: sparse visits (2.4/action at 10K steps) prevent viability alpha from building spread
3. I3: GPR breaks systematic coverage. Argmin works but ignores encoding.
4. L1: no composition with GPR reaches L1.

**Step 1261 composition (current best):** Argmin warm-up → GPR transition when conc > 0.1. Combined attention (C25 * viability) post-recurrent on ext_enc.
- LS20: R3=0.053, SAL=0.36 (both pass), transition at step 38 (fast)
- VC33: L1 recovered (5/5 at step 2118), transition at step 6220, SAL=-0.16 (insufficient GPR phase)
- SP80: never transitions (conc=0.055 at 10K, uniform action effects)

**Game-type split:** Small action spaces (LS20, 7 actions): viability works, transition fast, R3+SAL pass. Large click spaces (VC33, 4103): L1 recovered via argmin warm-up, but GPR phase too short for SAL. Uniform-response games (SP80): viability can't differentiate actions, stays in argmin permanently.

**Step 1263 (viability-weighted argmin):** SAL=1.00 (15/15, LS20 rho=0.85, VC33 0.49, SP80 0.54). First time SAL passes on ALL games. The encoding perfectly tracks per-action state-change differentiation. L1 unchanged (VC33 5/5 same as control, LS20/SP80 0/5). Gap: encoding knows what each action DOES individually but not what SEQUENCES do collectively. Navigation requires temporal composition.

**Step 1263 FINAL (viability-weighted argmin):** SAL=1.00 all games (LS20 rho=0.85). R3=0.67. L1 unchanged. Encoding perfectly tracks action effects but can't compose sequences.

**Step 1264 (no-selector LPL dynamics):** FAILED. Runaway positive feedback — Hebbian locks onto one action. VC33 regressed 5/5→0/5. SAL=-0.35. LPL creates instability without separate selector.

**Step 1265 (Physarum no-selector):** I4=0.73 (temporal structure passes). But argmax kills coverage — VC33 regressed 5/5→0/5. Same failure as LPL no-selector.

**Step 1266 (Physarum + argmin):** LS20 L1=1/5 (FIRST L1 from encoding-informed composition, outperforms pure argmin 0/5). VC33 L1=5/5 (coverage recovered). SAL=0.829 on LS20. I4=7% on LS20 (passes). Tube-weighted argmin: Physarum dynamics for encoding, argmin for coverage, tube thickness modulates visit priority.

**Step 1267 (anomaly flow + frozen-mean control):** COMPLETE (45 runs, 3 conditions). Mean drift is negligible: live SAL=0.800 vs frozen SAL=0.764 (nearly identical). Frozen I4=9.5% vs live I4=4.8% — slight improvement. Anomaly flow signal is real, not an artifact. VC33 5/5 L1 both conditions. LS20 L1=0/5 both (regression from 1266 raw-flow 1/5, different seeds).

**DIRECTION CHANGE (2026-03-27):** Stop testing at L1. L1 selects for coverage, not understanding. Higher levels require game understanding. Test: substrate observes solver playing all levels on seed A, then acts on seed B. Did the observation transfer?

**Step 1268 (per-level L_max instrumentation, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs). L_max=0 on ALL 30 draws — substrate never escapes L0 within 10K steps. Confirms direction change: solver handoff mandatory. FT09 physarum reached L1 (4/5 draws, ~7K steps), never L2. R3 passes on SP80/FT09 (0.083), dead on TR87 (0.003). SAL near-zero (rho<0.1 everywhere). I4=0 everywhere. lmax_i4 metric unmeasurable without solver transport. Awaiting Leo spec-gate resolution (missing control baseline + wiring spec) before building solver handoff infrastructure.

**Step 1272 (IncSFA for I1, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs, 785.6s). I1=null EVERYWHERE — structural measurement issue: repr_log collects only steps 0-1000, but FT09 L1 reached at ~6000-9000 steps → all repr entries are L0, no between-level pairs for I1. IncSFA does NOT improve L1 vs nSFA: SFA FT09 3/5 vs nSFA 4/5 (nSFA slightly better, within noise). FT09 nSFA draw4 reached Lmax=2 (FIRST L2 for Physarum+argmin composition). R3 stable: SP80/FT09 ~0.083-0.085 both conditions (pass), TR87 0.0035 both (fail). I3: FT09 ρ=0.96 both (pass). SP80 ρ=-0.46 (fail). TR87 varies. Conclusion: I1 is unmeasurable with current repr_log design, not because encoding fails. Measurement fix required before I1 can gate future specs.

**Step 1269 (solver handoff, SP80):** COMPLETE (10 runs). All 10 draws Lmax=FAIL(r=0.0). Solver transports substrate to L5 but substrate can't act within L5 — game timeout at step 120. Confirmed: solver handoff insufficient, substrate needs game-understanding not just placement.

**Step 1270 (observe-then-act, SP80):** CANCELLED after 1 partial draw. Observed all 6 levels on seed A (max_level_observed=6), R3=0.083 passes, but no L1 solve on act phase (seed B). Direction cancelled by Leo mail 3508.

**Step 1271 (ARC score vs solver baseline, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs). ARC=0.0 everywhere — efficiency gap ~1900x on FT09 (substrate L1 at ~7500 steps, solver at 4 steps). FT09 PHY: L1=4/5 vs CtrlC 0/5 (composition provides real L1 benefit). SP80/TR87: Lmax=0 all draws. R3 passes PHY on SP80/FT09 (5/5), fails TR87 (0/5). I3: FT09 both conditions 5/5, TR87 CtrlC 5/5 / PHY 0/5, SP80 0/5 (large action space). ARC score metric correct but provides no gradient at current performance — substrate is 1000-2000x less efficient than solver.

## Solved (locked findings)

1. **R3 solved by composition** (Step 1251). 7 cross-family components composed. Jacobian change 100/100 across 10 games, both wirings. Component-level, not wiring-dependent.

2. **Reflexive map principle confirmed** (Steps 1252-1253). Shared W for encoding and action selection through the same computation. When W changes, both change. No separate bridge needed. First I4 signal (1252). R3+I3 coexist (1253, VC33).

3. **Hierarchy inverted** (Step 1251). R3 passes first, not last. R3 and I3 are already solved. I4 partially solved. I5 blocked by L1 reachability.

4. **Separate selectors violate R2** (Steps 1251-1291, Jun 2026-03-28). Argmin, pe_ema, visit counts, refractory — all frozen frame components that decouple action selection from encoding. Argmin survived 30+ experiments through asymmetric kill criteria and broken I3_rho metric (Step 1279: 24+ false kills from index ordering artifact), not through constitutional compliance. Proposition 3 ("action selection solved") revised to NARROW — proves only that count-monotone → argmin, not that action selection is solved.

5. **Simplicity load-bearing** (PB30, n=6+). Adding complexity degrades. Fewer frozen parameters = better.

6. **W_action training signal is the bottleneck** (Steps 1289-1291). Three different selectors (softmax, refractory, dead-W) on same LPL-Hebbian W_action all produce VC33=0/5. LPL Hebbian trains W to track visual responsiveness, not level advancement. The selector is not the problem. The update dynamics are.

7. **Preview games are comfort zone traps** (Jun observation, 2026-03-28). FT09/VC33/LP85 (the 3 games argmin solves) select for argmin and against reflexive-map-driven selection. The 7 failing games are the real test. 10+ experiments solving only the same 3 games = per-game tuning of the search process itself.

## Negative Map (what doesn't work as R3→action bridge)

From 200+ debate experiments: alpha attention, forward models, directional attention, state-conditioned rankings, MI+attention, pixel scanning, EMA recency, empowerment, anti-correlated pairs, softmax concentration. All tested, all failed. The reflexive map (shared W) is the one architecture that isn't on this list. But the reflexive map's W_action training signal (LPL Hebbian) is on this list as of Step 1291.

## Phase History (fuel, not structure)

- **Phase 1 (Steps 1-416):** 416 experiments. process() = LVQ (1988). Constraint map extracted. R1-R6 formalized.
- **Phase 2 (Steps 417-1081):** 665 experiments. 16 families, 8 killed. 800b/916 as reference substrates. Graph ban, codebook ban (both lifted). Constraint map expanded. R3 remained at 0.
- **Debate v3 (Steps 1082-1250):** ~170 experiments. ℓ₁ vs ℓ_π. Both ≈ random at L1. Draw variance dominates. 200+ killed bridge mechanisms. PB26 (parity), PB30 (simplicity), PB31 (encoding resolution) confirmed.
- **Composition era (Steps 1251+):** Components composed. R3 solved. Allosteric principle. Stage instrumentation. Composition loop begins.

## Next Step

**Step 1273 (repr_log fix + dual I1, SP80/FT09/TR87):** COMPLETE (30 runs, 439.4s). **I1 is NOT the wall.** FT09 PHY: I1_enc=3/5 pass (within=0.855, between=1.113) AND I1_act=3/5 pass — both encoding and policy distinguish states when L1 is reached. I1 passes on the same draws, same rate: no bridge problem. SP80/TR87: I1=null (Lmax=0, only 1 level). ControlC FT09: Lmax=0, I1=null. R3: PHY passes SP80/FT09 (5/5), fails TR87 (0.045 < 0.05). I3: FT09 ρ=0.96 both conditions. TR87 CTL ρ=0.75 (pass), PHY ρ=-0.46 to -0.57 (fail). **Wall = what prevents SP80/TR87 from reaching L1.** SP80: uniform response, viability flat. TR87: R3 fails, no self-modification.

**Paradigm shift:** I1 was called "the wall" from Step 1253 to 1272 (20 steps). It was a broken measurement. The encoding DOES distinguish states (I1_enc passes 3/5 on FT09). The allosteric principle works (I1_enc and I1_act pass together). The real wall is L1 reachability on games where the composition can't build Physarum structure.

**Step 1274 (full 10-game PRISM chain):** COMPLETE (100 runs, 26.3 min). Chain ARC=0.0000010. Full failure mode map:

| Game | PHY L1 | CTL L1 | PHY R3 | PHY I3 | CTL I3 | PHY I1enc | Failure mode |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| ft09 | 4/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 3/5 | WORKING — PHY provides real L1 advantage |
| vc33 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | Easy L1 — CTL argmin also solves |
| lp85 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | null | null | 5/5 | Easy L1 — both conditions, identical l1_step=1870 (game seed-independent) |
| ls20 | 1/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | null | R3 borderline fail (0.044 vs 0.05 threshold), PHY I3 negative — Physarum hurts LS20 coverage |
| sb26 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | null | R3+I3 pass but L1=0 — requires specific click sequence, neither argmin nor Physarum discovers it |
| sp80 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | null | Uniform response — I3 fails both conditions |
| cd82 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | null | PHY I3 fails — Physarum tube reinforcement kills coverage on large click space |
| cn04 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | null | PHY I3 fails — same as cd82 |
| tr87 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | null | R3 fails — no self-modification (Jacobian diff ≈0.04 < 0.05 threshold) |
| tu93 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 5/5 | null | R3 fails — same as tr87 |

**Failure mode clusters:**
1. **R3 failure** (tr87, tu93, borderline ls20): W doesn't modify meaningfully. Physarum dynamics don't engage. Jacobian diff 0.04 vs threshold 0.05.
2. **I3 failure — Physarum kills coverage** (cd82, cn04): PHY I3 NEGATIVE where CTL I3 passes. Tube dynamics create action loops that hurt exploration on large click spaces.
3. **Uniform response** (sp80): Both conditions I3 fail. Action effects indistinguishable → no coverage signal.
4. **Sequence-locked** (sb26): All stages pass (R3+I3) but game requires specific click sequence not discoverable by exploration.
5. **Easy L1** (vc33, lp85): Physarum composition provides no unique advantage — argmin alone sufficient.
6. **PHY advantage** (ft09 only): R3+I3+I1 all pass, PHY L1=4/5 vs CTL=0/5. Composition provides real benefit on exactly ONE game.

**Key finding:** Composition works on FT09 only. The wall is not I1 (encoding works when L1 is reached), but stage prerequisites (R3 failing → no Physarum dynamics; I3 failing → Physarum reinforcement hurts coverage). LP85/VC33 L1 is free — CTL argmin also solves.

**Step 1275 (novelty-gated tube flow):** KILL. Novelty gate zero effect on I3. Root cause: Physarum conflates "changes encoding" with "should explore." Responsive actions produce the most novel deltas, so novelty gating still reinforces them. Physarum dynamics component KILLED after 5 consecutive failures (1271-1275).

**Step 1276 (LPL prediction error replaces Physarum):** KILL *(retroactively PASS under I3_cv — see Step 1280)*. 100 runs, 8.1 min.

| Game | LPE L1 | CTL L1 | LPE I3 | CTL I3 | LPE R3 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| ft09 | 4/5 | 0/5 | 0.96 (5/5) | 0.96 (5/5) | 0.947 (5/5) |
| ls20 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0.31 (2/5) | 0.64 (5/5) | 0.047 (0/5) |
| vc33 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 0.96 (5/5) | 0.96 (5/5) | 0.924 (5/5) |
| tr87 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0.42 (3/5) | 0.75 (5/5) | 0.046 (0/5) |
| sp80 | 0/5 | 0/5 | -0.46 (0/5) | -0.46 (0/5) | 0.909 (5/5) |
| sb26 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0.89 (5/5) | 0.89 (5/5) | 0.915 (5/5) |
| tu93 | 0/5 | 0/5 | -0.00 (0/5) | 0.86 (5/5) | 0.046 (0/5) |
| cn04 | 0/5 | 0/5 | -0.68 (0/5) | -0.68 (0/5) | 0.925 (5/5) |
| cd82 | 0/5 | 0/5 | 0.39 (0/5) | 0.39 (0/5) | 0.944 (5/5) |
| lp85 | 5/5 | 5/5 | null | null | 0.944 (5/5) |

Root cause: W_pred (256×256 linear) cannot discriminate loop vs game-advancing actions. Loop actions at different game states produce different encoding deltas → W_pred can't learn stable predictions → pe stays high for loop actions. PE diagnostic confirms no differentiation: LS20 top7 pe@5000 all similar (0.30-0.43), TR87 top7 all similar (0.085-0.103). New regression on TU93 (I3 -0.00 vs CTL 0.86). I3 regressed further on LS20/TR87 (worse than Physarum). FT09 L1 maintained (pe≈0 on click games, mechanism neutral). KILL: per-action prediction error signal is too noisy to differentiate action types in high-dimensional encoding space.

**Critical realization from 1276 PE diagnostic:** FT09 pe≈0 for all actions (mean 0.001). LPE ≈ pure argmin on FT09. Yet FT09 L1=4/5 vs CTL 0/5. The ONLY difference is LPL encoding modification (R3). The FT09 advantage was never from dynamics (Physarum or LPE). It's from R3. 12 steps investigating dynamics (1264-1276) when the encoding was doing all the work.

**Step 1277 (strip dynamics, bare LPL+argmin):** COMPLETE (100 runs, 7.9 min). Hypothesis overturned — and more precise.

FT09 L1=0/5 (same as CTL). R3 encoding alone does NOT explain FT09 advantage. Pe signal was contributing even at mean 0.001 — tiny absolute values create selective bias across 4103 actions when most have visit_count=0-2.

I3 FULLY RECOVERED: LS20=0.64(5/5), TR87=0.75(5/5), TU93=0.86(5/5) — all match CTL exactly. Pe dynamics WERE the regression source. Strip them → CTL I3 behavior restored.

**Key finding — pe scale sensitivity:** Pe signal has opposite effects by action space size:
- Large (FT09, 4103 actions): pe_ema mean=0.001, max=0.055. Tiny pe sufficient to differentiate game-advancing from loop clicks at scale. HELPS.
- Small (LS20, 7 actions): pe_ema mean=0.35. Pe values dominate argmin, kill coverage. HURTS.
- SELECTION_ALPHA=0.1 appropriate for FT09 but 100x too strong for LS20.

**Gap: pe normalization.** score = action_counts - alpha * (pe_ema / (max(pe_ema) + eps)) would bound signal to [0,1] regardless of action space. Preserves relative ordering on all games.

**Step 1278 (normalized pe):** KILL. 100 runs, 519.8s.

| Game  | NPE I3        | CTL I3        | NPE L1 | CTL L1 |

| sp80  | -0.464 (0/5)  | -0.464 (0/5)  | 0/5    | 0/5    |

FT09 L1 restored (3/5 vs CTL 0/5). Kill criterion triggered by I3 regressions on LS20 (2/5 vs CTL 5/5), TR87 (3/5 vs CTL 5/5), TU93 (0/5 vs CTL 5/5).

Root cause: normalization bounds pe to [0,1] but does NOT make pe invisible on KB games. EMA ramps up from first visit (~14 visits/action by step 100 on 7-action games). At step 100: LS20 pe_ema mean=0.276 (max/mean=1.06x), TR87 mean=0.042 (max/mean=1.38x), TU93 mean=0.124 (max/mean=1.36x). After normalization, top7 pe_norm values differ by ~0.15 → score difference ~0.015 against visit_count ~14. Early EMA bootstrap creates order-dependent bias before I3 measurement at step 200. FT09 pe@100 mean=0.000005 (4103 actions, only 7 visited) — normalization is essentially inactive on click games.

**Consolidated finding — pe signal on KB games:** Any pe-based action selection has early-step bootstrap problems on small action spaces (7 actions). Pe EMA ramps up faster than I3 can measure coverage (I3 measured at step 200, pe active from step 1). Scale-based fix (normalization) does not help because the signal is already structured by step 100. Temporal-based fix needed (delayed activation past step 200) OR a different signal that is zero at uniform visitation.

**Step 1279 (pe tiebreaker):** KILL. 100 runs, 519.5s.

| Game  | PTB I3        | CTL I3        | PTB L1 | CTL L1 |

Kill criterion: I3 regressions on LS20/TR87/TU93. FT09 L1=3/5 (maintained).

**I3 ARTIFACT CONFIRMED — LS20 I3 is broken metric (Step 1279 permutation diagnostic):**

CTL I3=0.64 on LS20 is entirely deterministic:
- CTL counts at step 200: [29,29,29,29,28,28,28] — IDENTICAL across all 5 draws/seeds
- LS20 kb_delta = [376,16,232,232,0,0,0] — actions 0-3 are responsive, 4-6 = 0
- Argmin always visits actions 0-3 first (200/7=28r4 → first 4 get extra visit)
- LS20's responsive actions happen to be indices 0-3 → Spearman=0.64 is fully determined by index ordering, not coverage quality

**Permutation test (10 runs, LS20):**
- CTL (index order): I3=0.643 (5/5 pass) — all seeds identical
- CTL (random permutation): I3=-0.279 (1/5 pass) — ranges from -0.857 to +0.64 depending on permutation

**Implication:** I3 "regressions" on LS20 in Steps 1274-1278 were measuring whether pe dynamics changed which action wins the argmin tie at step 200 — NOT whether coverage quality degraded. TR87 and TU93 are likely also artifact games (small action spaces, deterministic tie order correlating with kb_delta). All pe-based "LS20 I3 kills" may be false alarms from a broken metric.

I3 criterion on KB games needs replacement. SAL (action salience vs kb_responsiveness) is the better coverage proxy for small-action-space games. Pending Leo decision on retroactive reanalysis of 1275-1278.

**Step 1280 (fix I3 metric + re-run 1276):** COMPOSITION CONFIRMED. 115 runs (100 main + 15 I3_perm), 8.1 min.

**I3_cv (corrected metric): LPE == CTL on ALL 10 games. Zero regressions.**

I3_cv pass criterion: LPE_cv ≤ CTL_cv × 1.1. Pass ratio = 1.000 on all games (identical distributions).

**I3_perm artifact universal across all KB games:**
- LS20: CTL=0.643 → CTLp=-0.279
- TR87: CTL=0.750 → CTLp=-0.200
- TU93: CTL=0.857 → CTLp=-0.193

**Retroactive verdict (Steps 1274-1278):** All I3 regressions on KB games were false alarms from broken I3_rho metric. Coverage quality (I3_cv) was never degraded in those steps.

**pe_snapshot insight:** pe_ema bootstraps very differently by action space:
- FT09 (4103 actions): pe_ema mean=5e-6 at step 100 — essentially zero
- LS20 (7 actions): pe_ema mean=0.277 at step 100 — already active
Small-action-space pe bootstraps fast because each action is visited ~14x by step 100. This is why additive pe can influence LS20 I3_rho (changes tie-breaking order) but not FT09 I3_rho (pe too small to override counts).

**Conclusion:** Step 1276 (LPL PE, alpha=0.1, unnormalized) IS the current composition.
- FT09 L1=4/5 vs CTL 0/5 (real advantage, unchanged across 1276/1278/1279/1280)
- No I3_cv regressions on any game
- R3 borderline on 7-action games (0.046-0.049 vs 0.05 threshold) — marginal fail on LS20/TR87/TU93
- Next: Step 1281 (pe_delta = compression progress, replaces pe_ema as signal)

**Step 1281 (pe_delta compression progress):** KILL. 100 runs, 527s.

pe_delta = pe_ema_prev - pe_ema. Actions where pe is dropping fastest get priority.

| Game | LPED_cv | CTL_cv | LPED_L1 | CTL_L1 | LPED_R3 |
|------|---------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| ft09 | 4.4176 | 4.4176 | 3/5 | 0/5 | 0.947 |

| vc33 | 4.4176 | 4.4176 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 0.924 |
| (others unchanged vs CTL)  |

Kill criterion: FT09 L1 regressed 4/5 → 3/5 vs 1276 (pe_ema). No improvement on any game.

Root cause: pe_delta bootstrap harder than pe_ema. On FT09 (4103 actions, ~0.05 visits/action at step 200), most actions have pe_ema_prev = pe_ema = 0 → pe_delta = 0. Signal only activates on actions visited ≥2x. For LS20 (7 actions), pe_delta more aggressive than pe_ema (I3_rho -0.586 vs -0.307) — deeper artifact, same CV.

**1276 (pe_ema, alpha=0.1, unnormalized) confirmed as composition. FT09 L1=4/5 is the benchmark.**

**Step 1282 (eta_h=0.05 vs 0.01):** CONDITIONAL PASS. 100 runs, 780s.

I3_cv: E05 == E01 on all games. No regressions. FT09 kill criterion not triggered (4/5 ≥ 3/5).

TR87 anomaly: 6 actions, R3 essentially unchanged (0.0455→0.0460). flow signal (||enc_t+1 - enc_t||) likely near-zero on TR87 — obs doesn't change visually → W_action doesn't accumulate regardless of eta_h.

LS20/TU93 L1 still 0/5 despite R3 now passing — R3 is necessary but not sufficient. eta_h=0.05 adopted as new composition baseline (Leo mail 3579).

**Step 1283 (temporal PE: W_pred 256×320 on [enc;h] vs W_pred 256×256 on enc):** KILL. 100 runs, 879s.

| Game | TPE R3 | LPE R3 | TPE L1 | LPE L1 |

| (others) | 0.91-0.94 (5/5) ✓ | same | — | — |

I4: Both conditions identical (-79.55% click, -0.03% KB). Temporal PE provides zero I4 benefit.

Kill: FT09 L1 3/5 (TPE) vs 5/5 (LPE). W_pred on [enc;h] adds noise to PE signal on FT09 — click games are order-free (SET not sequence), so h_t context is irrelevant and degrades PE discrimination. No LS20 improvement. Kill criterion: FT09 L1 regression + no I4 gain.

**Full L1 prescription analysis (Step 1283, post-mortem):**

| Game | L1 actions | Unique | Type | Structure | PE reachable? |
|------|-----------|--------|------|-----------|---------------|
| FT09 | 2 | 2 | clicks | SET (2 pixels) | YES (1-2/5) |
| VC33 | 1 | 1 | click | SET (1 pixel) | YES (5/5) |
| LP85 | 3 | 1 | click | SET (1 pixel x3) | YES (5/5) |
| SB26 | 7 | 7 | clicks | SET/SEQ? (7 pixels) | MAYBE |
| SP80 | 2 | 1 | KB | SEQ (key x2) | NO |
| CD82 | 24 | 19 | mixed | SEQ (KB+clicks) | NO |

| LS20 | 13 | ? | KB | SEQ | NO |
| TR87 | ? | ? | KB | SEQ | NO |
| TU93 | ? | ? | KB | SEQ | NO |

**PE+argmin ceiling:** 3/10 games (FT09/VC33/LP85). PE works when L1 = 1-2 unique high-index click positions. Fails when L1 needs ordered sequences or ≥7 unique clicks. Remaining 7 games require temporal credit assignment (prospective, not retrospective PE).

**Step 1284 (KB injection diagnostic: forced KB action every 50 steps):** DIAGNOSTIC — wall confirmed as sequences, not coverage. 100 runs, ~14 min.

KB injection confirmed working: 200 forced KB actions per seed (steps % 50 == 0), ~28-33 visits per KB index 0-6.

| lp85 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 0.944 (5/5) ✓ | 4.487 | 4.418 |

FT09 slight regression (4/5 KBI vs 5/5 LPE): I3rho drops 0.96→~0.26 mean from forced KB injections polluting PE correlation on click-heavy games. I3cv unchanged. L1 maintained on VC33/LP85 despite I3rho drop (their prescriptions are simpler).

**Conclusion:** KB coverage alone is insufficient. ~29 visits per KB index, zero new games unlocked. SP80 and SB26 unchanged (Leo's predicted improvements did not materialize). Wall = sequential credit assignment: substrate visited KB actions but cannot detect which SEQUENCES advance the game. Next component class: temporal abstractions / macro-actions / successor representations for sequence discovery without reward signal.

**Step 1285 (N-step displacement, N=10, replaces pe_ema):** KILL. 100 runs, 687s.

Kill: FT09 L1 = 0/5 (regression from 5/5 LPE). No L1 improvement on any failing game.

Root cause: FT09 needs systematic argmin coverage of 4103 actions to find 2 target clicks. LPE works because pe_ema≈0 on FT09 → pure argmin. Displacement introduces spurious biases — early high-displacement windows boost wrong actions, breaking systematic coverage. argmin revisits boosted actions instead of continuing exploration.

I4 finding: displacement at N=10 produces no temporal structure. I4 = -79.5% on ALL click games in BOTH conditions (entropy increases over time as argmin covers more unique positions). I4 = -0.0% on KB games (flat distribution). Zero difference between D10 and LPE on I4.

Open questions: Is the wall the window size (need N≫10 for full sequence capture)? Or the attribution method (all window actions get equal displacement credit → dilutes signal)?

**SP80 count-dominance diagnostic (Eli mail 3604):** At step 5000, KB-3 pe_ema=0.29 (signal found, bonus=0.029) but argmin score=28.97 vs 0 for unvisited click. Discovery is permanent but unexploitable. Argmin-of-counts is structurally incompatible with KB sequence discovery — no selection signal fixes this within argmin.

**Literature connection — eigenoptions (Eli mail 3605):** W_action (4103×256) is already a one-step empirical SR. SVD → top-k right singular vectors = encoding directions most coupled to actions. Eigenoption policy: argmin_a ||h + W_action[a] - h_target|| where h_target = projection onto eigenvector subspace. Produces emergent sequences (goal-conditioned single-action selection). The Sketched Jacobian measured for R3 IS the same Jacobian eigenoptions exploit. Papers: Machado et al. JMLR 2023 (arxiv:2110.05740), ICLR 2024.

**Step 1286b (topological diagnostic, SP80 KBI 3K steps):** NOT SEPARABLE. h-trajectories during KB vs click action windows occupy same encoding region. Cosine within-KB=0.9406, within-click=0.9970, between=0.9849. Separation ratio=1.017 (threshold 1.2). PCA: KB centroid at (-0.015, -0.067), click centroid at (0.000, +0.001). LPL encoding does not represent action-type information in h-space. Caveat: measures pre-action h_t, not post-action h_{t+1}. Implication: eigenoptions (W_action SVD) unlikely to find KB-specific directions on undifferentiated-encoding games.

**Composition loop status (Steps 1271-1287, 17 experiments):**
- Confirmed composition: LPL + pe_ema + argmin, alpha=0.1, eta_h=0.05 (Step 1276/1282)
- Ceiling: 3/10 games at L1 (FT09 5/5, VC33 5/5, LP85 5/5)
- Wall: 7/10 games need sequence discovery. Argmin-of-counts structurally incompatible (count dominance). KB coverage insufficient (1284). N-step displacement insufficient (1285).
- Two broken measurements fixed (I1 repr_log, I3 index artifact)
- **Step 1286 (causal controls: frozen_init/frozen_mid/eta_slow/lpl_pe_ctrl): COMPLETE.** 200 runs (10 games × 4 conditions × 5 draws), 1539s.
  - **R3 is causally weight-driven.** frozen_init collapses R3 to ~0.001-0.05 (vs 0.66-0.94 for all other conditions). Weight updates are the mechanism.
  - **L1 performance is weight-learning-independent.** Games that solve (ft09/lp85/vc33) solve at equal rates across all 4 conditions including frozen_init. Games that fail (7) fail in all 4 conditions regardless.
  - frozen_mid R3 indistinguishable from CTL: 5K steps sufficient to establish full R3 signal.
  - eta_slow (×0.1) preserves R3 and L1 equally. Mechanism not rate-sensitive in this range.
  - I3_cv: identical across all conditions (3.098). Action selection mechanism unchanged.
  - arc_score: 0.000 in all conditions (no L2 reached).
  - Interpretation: R3 (self-modification) is real and weight-driven. But R3 without changed action selection (argmin unchanged) produces no behavioral change. Bottleneck confirmed as action selection, not representation learning.
- **Step 1287 (pairwise transition count argmin): KILL.** Zero new L1 on failing games. R3 regression LS20/TU93 (0.047 vs 0.086). Root cause: pairwise degenerates to pe_ema-argmax on click games (all pairs count=0 when prev=click), KB-KB pairs never accumulate consecutively.
  - I3 CV explosion on click games: FT09 PAR=32.81 vs CTL=4.42. Concentrated selection pattern.
  - FT09/VC33/LP85 maintained (no regression). 7 failing games unchanged.
- **Step 1288 (encoding-change momentum): KILL.** 100 runs (10 games × 2 conditions × 5 draws).
  - **FT09 hard regression:** MOM L1=0/5 vs CTL 0.80. Momentum fires at 34.6% on FT09, breaking systematic argmin coverage needed to find 2 target clicks among 4103.
  - **I3_cv regression +116%:** MOM I3_cv=6.678 vs CTL=3.098. Concentrated visitation — momentum repeats high-enc_change actions (any visually-responsive click), creating skewed distribution.
  - **I4 unchanged or worse:** MOM I4=-62.5% vs CTL=-55.7%. VC33/SP80 much worse (-141.9%/-131.1% vs -79.5%). No temporal structure improvement.
  - **R3 intact:** No R3 regression (0.670 both). R3 kill criterion not triggered.
  - Root cause: adaptive threshold (running median) means momentum fires on ~50% of all steps — far too frequently. High-enc_change actions are visually-interesting clicks, not game-advancing sequences. Temporal structure problem unresolved.
  - Open: fixed/higher-percentile threshold (90th?) would fire less and preserve I3 coverage. Not tested.
- **Step 1289 (allosteric softmax): KILL — test invalid.** 100 runs (10 games × 2 conditions × 5 draws), 846s.
  - **SAL overall:** L1=10/50 (0.20) vs CTL=14/50 (0.28). R3=0.6638 vs CTL=0.6694. I4=-50.1% vs CTL=-55.7%. I3_cv=3.22 vs CTL=3.10.
  - **vc33 catastrophic regression:** SAL 0/5 vs CTL 5/5. ls20 gain: SAL 2/5 vs CTL 0/5. ft09 slight regression: SAL 3/5 vs CTL 4/5.
  - **DECAY=0.001 killed W_action.** (0.999)^10000 ≈ 5e-5 → W_action ≈ 0 → std(salience) ≈ 1e-5 → T=1/std ≈ 100K. Observed: T_avg=59,570 (range 10K-215K across games). At T=60K, softmax is permanently uniform — allosteric connection never activated.
  - **Mechanism was never tested.** SAL = accidental uniform-random selection throughout entire run. Result: pe_argmin beats uniform-random (expected).
  - **R3 intact:** No collapse (0.664 vs 0.669). Weight learning unaffected.
  - Fix required: remove DECAY from W_action entirely (or normalize salience by ||W_action||) before retesting allosteric selection.
- **Step 1290 (allosteric softmax, DECAY removed): KILL — mechanism activated but harmful.** 100 runs (10 games × 2 conditions × 5 draws), 688s.
  - **SAL overall:** L1=8/50 (0.16) vs CTL=14/50 (0.28). Worse than 1289 (10/50) and worse than CTL.
  - **Mechanism confirmed active:** Removing DECAY fixed activation. Actual T (excluding step-0 initial 100M): FT09=57 (min 4.4), VC33=55 (min 6.7), LS20=5.2 (min 0.1), SB26=20 (min 11.6), TU93=13 (min 1.6). LS20 reaches T=0.1 — near-deterministic selection.
  - **Aggregation bug:** Summary script included step 0 (T=100M initial) in mean T — reported 85K-212K, actual 5-112. Mechanism was active throughout.
  - **VC33 catastrophic regression persists:** SAL 0/5 vs CTL 5/5 (same as 1289, but mechanism was active here — VC33 regression is real, not artifact).
  - **LS20 fully concentrated but still fails:** T_min=0.1 (deterministic), L1=0/5. W_action concentrates on high-pe actions that don't advance levels. R3 SAL=0.106 vs CTL=0.367 (CTL 3.5x higher).
  - **I4 split diagnostic:** LS20/TR87/TU93 show near-zero I4 for both conditions (CTL too). Large action-space games show I4=-71% SAL vs -79.5% CTL.
  - **Root cause:** pe_argmin uses counts term (exploration drive). SAL replaces this with Hebbian concentration on high-pe actions. Concentration on wrong actions = exploration eliminated = worse L1.
  - **Finding:** pe_argmin (counts - 0.1*pe_ema) is superior to softmax(W_action@ext/T) as action selector. Allosteric softmax removes exploration and concentrates on visually-responsive but level-irrelevant actions.
- **Step 1291 (refractory cycling): KILL — W_action problem confirmed across 3 selectors.** 100 runs (10 games × 2 conditions × 5 draws), 637s.
  - **REF overall:** L1=5/50 (0.10) vs CTL=14/50 (0.28). Kill criteria both triggered: total <10/50 AND no new game L1; VC33=0/5 AND FT09=2/5 ≤ 2/5.
  - **VC33 catastrophic regression (3rd consecutive):** REF 0/5 vs CTL 5/5. Three different selectors (dead W_action 1289, softmax 1290, refractory 1291) all produce VC33=0/5. Not a selector problem — W_action's learned structure is hostile to VC33.
  - **FT09 regression:** REF=2/5 vs CTL=4/5. Refractory cycling less systematic than argmin's exhaustive sweep over 4103 actions.
  - **CN04 Hebbian instability:** REF R3=6.83 (84x CTL) is weight explosion artifact, not meaningful self-modification. CN04 has tiny action space (~5 actions), nsup=3 leaves only 2 active, each visited ~2500x. W_action rows grow unboundedly without decay — activation std blows up from 0.097 (step 100) to 24.9 (step 9500), max activation=1356. R3 measures Jacobian diff of W_action@ext vs fresh — enormous because W_action magnitude is enormous.
  - **REF R3 uniformly higher:** REF R3 > CTL R3 on 8/10 games (LS20 1.5x, TU93 1.7x, SP80 1.3x, SB26 1.4x, VC33 1.4x, LP85 2.2x, CN04 84x). More frequent W_action updates from repeated small-action-space cycling amplifies Jacobian diff.
  - **I4: refractory reduces exploration:** Most games show REF I4 near 0% or even positive, vs CTL -79.5%. Refractory creates temporal structure but insufficient entropy reduction.
  - **Decision tree outcome (Leo spec):** VC33=0/5 across all 3 selectors → W_action problem confirmed. LPL Hebbian training signal for W_action doesn't produce action-relevant structure. Next: different W_action training signal.
- **Step 1292 (Lotka-Volterra / winnerless competition): KILL.** 100 runs, 678s. LV L1=0/50 vs CTL=14/50. I3_cv 10-120x worse than CTL on all 10 games. Cycling collapsed to single-winner lock (cycle length 1.0-1.8). Root cause: Hebbian winner feedback on W_drive creates identical positive lock as LPL on W_action. Anti-Hebbian decorrelation (row mean subtraction) insufficient. LV is architecturally different but behaviorally identical to W_action collapse.
- **Step 1292b (minimal reflexive network, capacity diagnostic): COMPLETE — capacity exists.** 30 runs (3 games × 2 conditions × 5 draws). N=64 fixed-size network, Oja on W_drive, frozen W_inhibit (lateral inhibition), frozen W_readout. **FT09: silhouette=0.94, MI=0.53 — multiple distinct attractors form. SP80: silhouette=0.89, MI=0.34 — competitive dynamics active. LS20: silhouette=0.99(k=2) but lock=1.00 — single-winner collapse on small action space.** L1=0/15, R3=0.0 (expected — W_readout frozen). Network develops internal structure on large action spaces. Problem: Oja winner feedback collapses small action spaces; frozen W_readout disconnects attractors from useful actions.

**Universal finding (Steps 1289-1292b, 5 experiments):** Any Hebbian rule that strengthens the winner's coupling to input creates winner-take-all collapse. This is the same pathology across softmax (1290), refractory (1291), Lotka-Volterra (1292), and Oja (1292b/LS20). The update rule is the disease. Not the selector, not the topology, not the dynamics.

**Open question (Jun, 2026-03-28):** The substrate has no mechanism for forming models — of itself, of levels, of game structure, of anything. A system that scores 0% on SWE-bench (or any task requiring understanding) and ceilings at L1-on-3-games may be in the wrong architectural category for the win condition (ALL LEVELS). The gap may not be "better update rule" but "architectural capacity for compositional representation." Whether R1-R6 compliance can produce understanding without the architectural foundations (depth, attention, composition) that enable it in LLMs is the central open question.
- **Step 1292 (Lotka-Volterra / winnerless competition dynamics): KILL.** 100 runs (10 games × 2 conditions × 5 draws), 678s.
  - **LV overall:** L1=0/50 vs CTL=14/50. Zero L1 on every game.
  - **I3_cv explosion:** LV I3_cv vs CTL across all games: FT09=63.98 vs 4.42 (14.5x), LS20=2.41 vs 0.02 (120x), VC33=47.02 vs 4.42 (10.6x), TR87=2.45 vs 0.02 (122x), SP80=50.69 vs 4.42 (11.5x), SB26=64.05 vs 4.42 (14.5x), TU93=2.44 vs 0.02 (122x), CN04=42.07 vs 4.42 (9.5x), CD82=41.87 vs 4.42 (9.5x), LP85=64.05 vs 4.42 (14.5x). ALL 10 games fail I3_cv criterion (>2x CTL). Kill criterion triggered.
  - **Cycling: near zero.** mean_cycle_distinct=1.0-1.83 across all games (barely above single winner). max_activation=0.009-0.013 — near-zero activation throughout 10K steps. LV dynamics degenerated to permanent single-winner lock.
  - **Root cause:** W_drive Hebbian reinforcement (ETA_LV=0.01, anti-Hebbian decorrelation) creates the same positive feedback as LPL on W_action. Early random winner gets W_drive[winner] row reinforced → same action wins next step → row grows further → permanent lock to initial random winner. Anti-Hebbian decorrelation (subtracting row mean) was insufficient to break this loop. Activation remains near-zero (max_act≈0.01) because the competition collapses before activations can grow.
  - **Not a different mechanism.** LV is architecturally different (continuous activation dynamics, global inhibition) but behaviorally identical to W_action collapse (1289-1291). The winner-takes-all pathology is in the W update, not the selector. Any Hebbian rule trained on winner feedback creates this loop.
  - **Per-game summary:** FT09 cyc=1.00, LS20 cyc=1.10, VC33 cyc=1.10, TR87 cyc=1.00, SP80 cyc=1.83 (highest), SB26 cyc=1.00, TU93 cyc=1.00, CN04 cyc=1.25, CD82 cyc=1.08, LP85 cyc=1.00.
- **Step 1292b (minimal reflexive network capacity diagnostic): DIAGNOSTIC COMPLETE.** 30 runs (3 games × 2 conditions × 5 draws). Separate from composition loop — tests whether N=64 competitive network can form attractor structure from game observations.
  - **Architecture tested:** MINIMAL = N=64 neurons, W_drive (64×320) Oja plasticity, W_inhibit (64×64) frozen U(0.5,1.5) lateral inhibition (diag=0), W_readout (n_actions×64) frozen. 10 sub-steps LV dynamics per game step. Action = argmax(W_readout @ activation).
  - **Attractor structure confirmed on FT09/SP80:** sil=0.94 (FT09), 0.89 (SP80). MI=0.53 (FT09), 0.34 (SP80). Multiple distinct attractor states form from game observations.
  - **LS20 single-winner collapse:** lock=1.00, MI=0.006 (near-zero entropy → near-zero MI), sil=0.99(k=2) — collapses to 2-state (on/off). Small action space (7 actions) → insufficient diversity to prevent winner lock.
  - **L1: 0/15** (all conditions). W_readout frozen → actions are random projections of activations → no connection to game-advancing actions.
  - **R3: 0.0000** on all games. Oja plasticity updates W_drive only; W_readout frozen → Jacobian of action selection vs obs unchanged → R3=0. Expected for diagnostic.
  - **Key finding:** Capacity exists (N=64 can form multiple attractors on FT09/SP80). The problem is not capacity — it's that W_readout must be learned to connect activation patterns to useful actions. Frozen readout = random action selection regardless of internal state richness.
  - **LINEAR baseline:** lock=0.49-0.90, cyc=5.4-17.2 (more cycling than MINIMAL due to LPL Hebbian update), R3=0.0001-0.0008. Both conditions fail L1 equally.
- **Step 1293 (three-factor plasticity on recurrent weights): CONDITIONAL PASS — no kill triggered, two predictions failed.** 36 runs (3 games × 3 conditions × 4 draws, N_DRAWS=4 for budget compliance), ~288s.
  - **Kill criteria: NOT triggered.** 3F k=2.0/3.5/4.8 (>1.5 on FT09/SP80), lock=1.00/0.75/0.49 (>0.8 on LS20 only, not all games). UNGATED ≠ THREE-FACTOR (pe gate demonstrably matters: FT09 lock 0.93→0.75, corr 0.835→0.083).
  - **Per-game results:**

| | LS20 | FT09 | SP80 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3F sil(k) | 0.990(2.0) | 0.934(3.5) | 0.922(4.8) |
| 3F lock | 1.000 | 0.748 | 0.490 |
| 3F mi | 0.009 | 0.476 | 0.273 |
| 3F corr | 0.932 | 0.083 | 0.186 |
| 3F reorg | 11x | 42x | 0.9x |
| UNG lock | 0.991 | 0.928 | 0.475 |
| FRZ lock | 0.990 | 0.551 | 0.474 |

  - **Prediction 3 (3F won't collapse): CONFIRMED on FT09/SP80, FAILED on LS20.** Small action space (7 actions) locks regardless of plasticity rule — same as 1292b. FT09/SP80 have stable multi-attractor dynamics with three-factor plasticity.
  - **Prediction 4 (attractor-state corr > 0.3 on FT09): FAILED.** 3F corr=0.083 — attractors stable but NOT game-phase-aware. The internal states don't reorganize to track game progression.
  - **Prediction 2 (UNGATED collapses): PARTIALLY CONFIRMED.** UNG lock=0.928 vs 3F lock=0.748 on FT09. Pe gate reduces lock. But FROZEN lock=0.551 — recurrence itself adds lock even with pe gating.
  - **Critical unexpected finding:** FROZEN has LESS lock than THREE-FACTOR on FT09 (0.55 vs 0.75). Recurrent connections create winner-excites-itself feedback at inference time, independent of learning. The pe gate prevents chronic weight drift (3F corr=0.083 vs UNG corr=0.835) but doesn't prevent inference-time recurrent reinforcement.
  - **Pe gate confirmed effective:** Three-factor rule prevents temporal drift (corr: 3F=0.083 vs UNG=0.835), reduces lock (0.928→0.748 on FT09), and triggers 42x more surprise-reorganization vs FROZEN (2.2). The gate works — it just doesn't solve the structural problem.
  - **R3=0.0 everywhere** (W_readout frozen, expected).
  - **Decision tree outcome (Leo spec):** "Prediction 3 confirmed, 4 wrong → attractors form but not game-phase-aware. Need different surprise signal or longer timescale." Recurrence-adds-lock finding is NEW — not in decision tree. Recurrent winner feedback is a structural problem separate from the learning rule.

- **Step 1294 (zero-diagonal recurrence): ZERO-DIAG KILLED, NEG-DIAG CONFIRMED.** 39 runs (3 ARC games × 3 cond × 4 draws + MBPP × 3 cond × 1 draw), 234s.
  - **Kill criterion triggered for ZERO-DIAG:** ZD lock=0.926 > 3F lock=0.748 on FT09. Removing self-excitation (diagonal=0) made lock WORSE. Off-diagonal off-diagonal entries A→B→A create compensating lock chains.
  - **NEG-DIAG confirmed prediction 1:** ND lock=0.549 < FROZEN baseline 0.551 on FT09 (barely). Active self-suppression works where passive removal fails.
  - **Per-game results:**

| | LS20 | FT09 | SP80 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3F lock (control) | 0.998 | 0.748 | 0.490 |
| ZD lock | 0.997 | 0.926 ← KILL | 0.475 |
| ND lock | 0.997 | 0.549 ← BELOW FROZEN | 0.473 |
| 3F sil(k) | 0.990(2.0) | 0.934(3.5) | 0.922(4.8) |
| ZD sil(k) | 0.990(2.0) | 0.934(3.8) | 0.934(4.5) |
| ND sil(k) | 0.990(2.0) | 0.919(4.0) | 0.919(5.2) |
| 3F corr | 0.932 | 0.083 | 0.186 |
| ZD corr | 0.500 | 0.891 | 0.145 |
| ND corr | 0.883 | -0.008 | 0.172 |
| 3F mi | 0.009 | 0.476 | 0.273 |
| ZD mi | 0.016 | 0.156 | 0.374 |
| ND mi | 0.021 | 0.861 | 0.373 |

  - **Key finding 1:** Zero-diagonal makes it WORSE (0.926 > 0.748). Off-diagonal recurrent entries form lock chains independently of self-excitation. Plain removal insufficient.
  - **Key finding 2:** Negative diagonal (-0.1) reduces FT09 lock to 0.549, just below FROZEN baseline (0.551). Active self-suppression creates refractory-like dynamics from within W_recur.
  - **Corr reversal:** ZD creates high temporal correlation (0.891) but MORE lock. ND creates near-zero corr (-0.008) but LESS lock. Active inhibition suppresses both locking AND temporal structure.
  - **ND MI explosion:** ND FT09 mi=0.861 vs 3F mi=0.476. Higher sequential MI suggests richer action sequence dynamics when self-suppression forces winner cycling.
  - **MBPP baseline confirmed:** All 3 conditions: L1=0/1, arc=0.000. Random action substrate generates no valid Python. Numerical overflow in 3F MBPP (W_drive instability at 10K steps of continuous ASCII input — different from ARC game episodic resets).
  - **Decision tree outcome:** ZD: "Prediction 1 wrong → off-diagonal W_recur entries also create lock chains → need full E/I separation." ND: "Prediction 1 confirmed AND dramatically better than ZD → active self-suppression is the key mechanism. Build into architecture permanently." Phase 2 (unfreeze W_readout) triggered by ND confirmation.

- **Step 1295 (Phase 2 — learned W_readout on NEG-DIAG base): ALL PREDICTIONS WRONG — W_readout learning negligible.** 39 runs (36 ARC + 3 MBPP), ~304s.
  - **L1=0 everywhere.** Prediction 3 (any L1) wrong.
  - **R3=0 everywhere.** Prediction 1 (behavioral R3 > 0) wrong.
  - **Root cause:** W_readout update `W_readout[action] += 0.001 * pe * activation` where activation winner ≈ 0.02 → update ≈ 2e-5 per element. With n_actions=4103, each action visited ~2.4 times in 10K steps → cumulative drift per row ≈ 6e-5 → total Frobenius ≈ 0.000 (below 3-decimal rounding). **Activation magnitudes too small for readout learning at large action spaces.**
  - **Scale evidence:**
    - FT09 (4103 actions): LRO ro_drift=0.000, URO ro_drift=0.013
    - SP80 (smaller action space): LRO ro_drift=0.090, URO ro_drift=0.613
    - MBPP (128 actions, ~78 visits/row): LRO ro_drift=1.201, URO ro_drift=1.691
    - Drift scales inversely with action space size — confirms action visit frequency as bottleneck.
  - **Kill criteria not triggered** (LRO lock=0.758 on FT09 < 0.8, I3cv stable). Architecture structurally sound; failure is learning signal scale, not instability.
  - **URO FT09: lock=0.549, MI=0.861** — seeds 102/202/302/402 replicate 1294 NEG-DIAG exactly (same seeds). Cross-validates 1294's key result.
  - **MBPP LRO drift=1.201:** Readout DID learn on 128-action space. Still L1=0 (random substrate can't generate Python), but learning mechanism itself works. Confirms problem is scale, not architecture.
  - **Fix required:** Normalize activation before readout update (`act_norm = activation / max(||activation||, eps)`) OR increase W_drive init from 0.01 to 0.1 to get 10x larger drive magnitudes. Either ensures update magnitude is ~0.001 per step regardless of absolute activation scale.
  - **Decision tree outcome:** Falls outside spec's 3 branches. New failure mode: "activation scale too small for readout learning at large action spaces." Not "readout learns but fails" — readout doesn't learn. Fix: normalized activation update, then retry Phase 2.

- **Step 1296 (Phase 2 retry — activation normalization fix, full PRISM chain): SCALE FIX CONFIRMED — W_drive bottleneck exposed.** 165 runs (150 ARC + 15 MBPP), ~21 min.
  - **L1=0/10 games** across all conditions. R3=0.000 everywhere. Both predictions wrong on progression.
  - **Scale fix CONFIRMED:** ro_drift now measurable where action space is smaller. 1295's problem (near-zero updates) is solved.
    - VC33 LRO ro_drift=0.262 (was 0.000 in 1295), SP80 LRO=0.678, CN04 LRO=0.352, CD82 LRO=0.103, MBPP LRO=0.191
    - FT09 LRO ro_drift still low (large action space, few visits/row) but not zero on all games
  - **NEW ROOT CAUSE — W_drive bottleneck:** W_readout is now learning on accessible action spaces, but W_drive (Oja) NEVER fires. Reason: competitive inhibition W_inhibit (0.5-1.5 uniform init) >> W_drive (init 0.01). Win_act ≈ 0 throughout all 165 runs → Oja gate `win_act > 1e-8` never triggers → W_drive frozen → R3=0.000 identically.
  - **Kill criteria not triggered:** FT09 LRO lock=0.771 < 0.8 (threshold). LRO I3_cv not > 3× FRO on 2+ games. Architecture structurally stable.
  - **Two separate problems now identified:**
    1. W_readout scale — FIXED in 1296 (activation normalization)
    2. W_drive learning — NEW: W_inhibit overwhelms W_drive signal. Oja rule never fires. R3=0 is a structural consequence, not a learning failure.
  - **Fix options for W_drive bottleneck:**
    - A: Increase W_drive init from 0.01 to 0.1-0.5 (10-50x). W_drive can compete with W_inhibit.
    - B: Reduce W_inhibit scale (0.5-1.5 → 0.01-0.05). Balance changes; same win_act magnitude.
    - C: Remove competitive inhibition architecture entirely. Replace with direct normalized W_drive (no W_inhibit). Cleaner but loses NEG-DIAG recurrence baseline.
  - **Next:** Fix W_drive init (Option A or B), rerun. Step 1297.

- **Step 1297 (W_drive init 0.01 → 0.1, full PRISM chain): OJA FIX CONFIRMED — R3 still near zero, new bottleneck.** 165 runs, ~21 min.
  - **Oja fix CONFIRMED:** oja_fire_count≈9997-9999/10000 steps (was 0 in 1296). W_drive IS now learning.
  - **wdrive_drift measurable:** 0.11–3.73 across games (was 0 in 1296). Largest: CN04 FRO=3.73, SP80 LRO=2.99, MBPP LRO=3.34.
  - **win_act non-trivial:** 0.0003–2.95 (was ≈0 in 1296). CN04 FRO=1.04, MBPP FRO=2.95. Competitive inhibition is now actually competitive.
  - **Attractors STABLE:** sil > 0.86 everywhere (was feared < 0.5 if inhibition was load-bearing). Architecture intact.
  - **Kill criteria NOT triggered:** FT09 LRO lock=0.753 (mean, < 0.8 threshold). Individual seeds: [0.421, 0.999, 1.0, 0.526, 0.82] — seeds 2/3 fully locked, but average passes. No I3cv kill (LRO/FRO ratio < 3 on all games).
  - **L1 = 0/10 games.** R3 = 0.0001–0.0028 (STILL below 0.05 threshold). W_drive is changing but Jacobian sensitivity is unchanged.
  - **I3cv inflated dramatically:** FT09 LRO=61 (was 4.4 in 1296), VC33 LRO=18, SP80 LRO=25. Action selection is now highly concentrated — substrate picks few actions repeatedly. Not a kill (LRO/FRO ratio ≈1.02 for FT09), but coverage collapsed.
  - **New bottleneck — Jacobian gap:** wdrive_drift=3.7 (significant weight change) but R3=0.0001 (Jacobian unchanged). Two explanations: (A) Oja converges W_drive toward input eigenvectors, but fresh W_drive is already oriented similarly in high-dimensional space (eigenvectors of random inputs), or (B) _enc_frame has small Jacobian (obs perturbations don't propagate to encoding). MBPP (R3=0.0028, highest) supports explanation B — MBPP has simpler obs structure.
  - **Three problems now isolated:** (1) W_readout scale — FIXED in 1296. (2) W_drive Oja activity — FIXED in 1297. (3) Jacobian sensitivity — NEW. R3 metric may not capture W_drive learning in this architecture. Need R3 recalibration or direct comparison of W_drive action distributions.
  - **Next:** PRISM baseline sweep (20 draws × 3 conditions × 11 games = 660 runs). Jun directive. Establishes THE reference for all future comparisons. Step 1298.

- **Step 1298 (PRISM baseline sweep — RANDOM / ARGMIN / PE-EMA, 20 draws × 3 conds × 11 games = 660 runs): COMPLETE. THE reference established.** 660 substrate pairs (1320 episodes), ~85 min.
  - **L1 by game — 3 reachable games, 8 opaque:**
    - FT09: RAND=14/20, ARGMIN=0/20(!), PE-EMA=18/20
    - VC33: RAND=3/20, ARGMIN=20/20, PE-EMA=20/20
    - LP85: RAND=18/20, ARGMIN=20/20, PE-EMA=20/20
    - LS20, TR87, SP80, SB26, TU93, CN04, CD82: 0/20 all conditions
  - **FT09 ARGMIN anomaly:** RAND=14/20 but ARGMIN=0/20. FT09 n_actions=4096 (64×64 grid), 10K steps covers only ~2.4 visits/action. Systematic coverage fails — argmin needs ~4096 steps before revisiting. Random with 10K steps finds the needed position by chance (75/4096 target density). This is the ARGMIN coverage trap for large action spaces.
  - **RHAE (chain mean):** RAND=8.22e-06 (above 1e-6 threshold), ARGMIN=8.18e-07 (RHAE-DEAD), PE-EMA=8.86e-07 (RHAE-DEAD). Confirmed: only the floor exists above 1e-6. Our current architectures are RHAE-dead at the chain level.
  - **Second-exposure speedup — FIRST TIME MEASURED across 1298 experiments:**
    - RAND: 28 pairs, 2.77x (artifact — random has no cross-episode memory; sampling bias)
    - ARGMIN: 40 pairs, **15.57x** (mechanistic — visit counts persist, episode B starts with prior coverage map)
    - PE-EMA: 55 pairs, **1.16x** (near-null — substrate memory carries state but minimal exploitation)
    - FINDING: speedup is real but mechanistic. ARGMIN's 15x is visit count transfer, not learning. PE-EMA barely above 1x despite carrying W state. No substrate has EVER shown genuine second-exposure speedup from understanding.
  - **I3cv:** Small-space games (LS20/TR87/TU93): RAND≈0.17, ARGMIN≈0.017 (uniform). Large-space games: RAND≈4.53, ARGMIN≈4.42 (both concentrated — sparse coverage of 4096 actions).
  - **R3 (PE-EMA only):** Consistent 0.009–0.013 across large-action-space games. 0.0004–0.0008 on small-space games. Jacobian diff present but below 0.05 pass threshold everywhere.
  - **MBPP:** 0/20 L1 all conditions. KL from uniform decays (step100→step1000): RAND 0.71→0.06, ARGMIN 0.25→0.001, PE-EMA 0.25→0.001. Distribution convergence without functional output.
  - **THE REFERENCE (future comparisons gate on):** RAND L1 rates {ft09:14, vc33:3, lp85:18}/20. ARGMIN L1 rates {vc33:20, lp85:20}/20. PE-EMA L1 rates {ft09:18, vc33:20, lp85:20}/20. RHAE floor: RAND=8.2e-6, ARGMIN/PEEMA < 1e-6. Speedup floor: RAND 2.8x (noise), ARGMIN 15.6x (visit persistence), PEEMA 1.2x (near-null).
  - **Next:** Step 1299 — forward model spec from Leo (per-action W_forward[a], plasticity gating). Step 1300+ — childhood protocol.

- **Step 1253b (catalog revisit — allosteric softmax vs CTL vs PE-EMA, full PRISM chain): KILL CRITERION TRIGGERED — I3cv inflation on 3 games.** 166 runs (150 ARC + 15 MBPP + 1 duplicate), ~35 min.
  - **Kill criterion #1** (ALLO L1 ≤ CTL L1 all games): NOT triggered. ALLO beats CTL on FT09 (2/5 vs 0/5), ties on LP85 (5/5).
  - **Kill criterion #2** (ALLO I3cv > 3× CTL on 3+ games): **TRIGGERED.** LS20=23x, TR87=22x, TU93=18x. Softmax concentrates on specific actions in small-space games → coverage collapse on 3 games.
  - **Per-game trade-off (KILL condition):** ALLO gains FT09 (2/5) but kills VC33 (0/5 vs CTL 5/5). Improves one game at the cost of another = per-game tuning pattern = KILL.
  - **PE-EMA strictly dominates ALLO:** FT09 pe_ema=4/5 vs allo=2/5. VC33 pe_ema=5/5 vs allo=0/5. No I3cv inflation on PE-EMA (identical to CTL on all 10 games).
  - **R3 signal (weak):** ALLO R3=0.003-0.009, PE-EMA R3=0.005-0.011, CTL R3=0.000. Both learning substrates show nonzero Jacobian diff but no functional consequence (L1=0 on 8/10 games for ALLO).
  - **RHAE=0 everywhere.** All conditions RHAE-dead (lp85 achieves L1 but efficiency²=0 without optimal solving).
  - **L1 by game:** lp85=5/5 (all), ft09: pe_ema=4, allo=2, ctl=0. vc33: ctl+pe_ema=5, allo=0. All 8 other games: 0/5 all conditions.
  - **Verdict: ALLO killed.** C#19 allosteric softmax not viable for current composition. PE-EMA (C#17 from step 1282) remains best non-argmin action selector. Original step 1253 abandonment was effectively correct — PE-EMA was already superior. Catalog entry for C#19 confirmed negative.
  - **Script self-check printed:** "PASS: ALLO beats CTL on >= 1 game. Original step 1253 was abandoned prematurely." This refers to criterion #1 only. Criterion #2 (I3cv) triggers the kill.

- **Step 1299 (action-aware forward model C34 — plasticity gate): COMPLETE. KILL — W_inhibit dominance confirmed, architecture dead end.** 330 draws (3 conditions × 11 games × 10 draws), 6218s.
  - **L1=0/10 all games, all conditions.** R3=0.0001-0.0003 (0 pass). Three conditions (FWD/OBS/NOGATE) IDENTICAL — gate has zero effect.
  - **Forward PE learning IS happening:** 91/110 FWD draws show forward PE decrease for ≥1 action. Signal present, nowhere to land.
  - **Confirmed diagnosis (Leo early read):** W_inhibit (frozen, 0.5-1.5 uniform) >> W_drive (init 0.1) dominates. W_drive Oja fires ~9999/10000 steps but Jacobian sensitivity = 0.0001. LP85 regressed 5/5→0/5 vs 1282 base — architecture kills what 1282 could do.
  - **Conclusion:** 64-neuron competitive inhibition network is architecturally incompatible with R2. Frozen W_inhibit = frozen evaluator (same violation as argmin). Forward model concept valid — has no substrate to improve.
  - **Next:** Step 1301 — return to linear reflexive map (Step 1264 base) with anti-Hebbian decorrelation to fix collapse.

- **Step 1301 (DHL anti-collapse linear reflexive map): RUNNING.** Leo mail 3665. 3 conditions × 11 games × 5 draws = 165 runs. ETA ~25 min.
  - DHL: Oja + sparse anti-Hebbian (K=20) + soft bound. OJA-ONLY: Oja alone (expected to collapse). ARGMIN-PE: 1282 reference.
  - Kill: DHL collapse >80% on 3+ games; DHL I3_cv >3× ARGMIN-PE on 3+ games.

- **Step 1300 (StochasticGoose PRISM baseline — leaderboard leader): RUNNING.** Jun directive, Leo mail 3662/3663. 11 games × 20 draws = 220 pairs. ETA ~8 hours remaining.
  - Port of DriesSmit/ARC3-solution (exact CNN architecture, training loop, buffer)
  - CNN: Conv2d 32→64→128→256 + MaxPool action head (5 discrete) + spatial coord head (4096)
  - Binary frame-change reward; buffer reset + model reset on level transition
  - CUDA (RTX 4090) for feasibility — architecture unchanged
  - Action mapping: SG 0-4 → PRISM keyboard 0-4; SG 5-4100 → PRISM click 7-4102
  - Limitation: SG can't access keyboard actions 5-6 (7-key games like LS20 lose 2 keys)
  - MBPP: random fallback (SG not designed for text obs)
  - Research questions: L2+ reachability, RHAE, second-exposure speedup (zero by design — buffer+model reset at each level), vs RAND/ARGMIN/PE-EMA
